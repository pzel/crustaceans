<p>Having a need to write some BDD-esque tests without the need of putting them in front of non-technical people, I was recently playing around with <a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/feature-specs/feature-spec">rspec feature specs</a>. Where I&rsquo;ve used these previously we&rsquo;ve eventually run into curation issues where the specs are outdated, brittle and require so much maintenance we&rsquo;ve generally ended up lobbing cucumber into the project as a stopgap.</p>
<p>This is due to ending up with feature specs like the following, which lead you to having to parse the code mentally to work out what it&rsquo;s testing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-ruby"><span class="no">RSpec</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">feature</span> <span class="s2">"Admin: Posts"</span> <span class="k">do</span>

</code></pre></div><p>After some reading around, I eventually stumbled back across <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/info/blog/how-we-write-readable-feature-tests-with-rspec">this idea from Future Learn</a> where they lay out the above test by splitting it into private methods within the feature block, but leaving it more readable to future readers. I then found <a href="https://www.madetech.com/blog/feature-testing-with-rspec">Made Tech&rsquo;s take on this same idea</a>, and riffing off the both of them ended up with the following instead:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Now this is fine, but writing lots_of_names_with_underscores_in_is_a_trifle <strong>irritating</strong>. Now I remember <a href="https://weirichinstitute.com/about">Jim Weirich</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://caiustheory.com/feed.xml#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> showing off <a href="https://github.com/rspec-given/rspec-given">rspec-given</a> at a conference a few years ago, and wondered if that would solve my problem here of wanting to have runtime warn me when my methods are misspelled or missing, without having_to_underscore_them.</p>
<p>Now rspec-given would let me do that, but I&rsquo;d have to switch from calling them all in turn inside a scenario block to calling them inside context blocks and passing blocks to each of the <code>Given</code>, <code>When</code>, etc methods. I think it would be something like (warning, untested)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-ruby"><span class="no">Rspec</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">feature</span> <span class="s2">"Admin: Posts"</span> <span class="k">do</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now this didn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> fit with what I wanted. However, I did wonder if it was possible to go down the route of having a <code>Given</code> method that takes a token to identify the code it should call. (A method if you will.) It&rsquo;s possible in ruby to call a method starting with a Capital letter, but convention dictates those are usually class/module names (constants) rather than methods.</p>
<p>A little bit of hacking later and this is what I ended up getting working:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-ruby"><span class="no">RSpec</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">feature</span> <span class="s2">"Admin: Posts"</span> <span class="k">do</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now there&rsquo;s two extra things that makes this easier for me to write than underscored methods. Ruby doesn&rsquo;t only allow <code>:foo</code> as a symbol, it also allows <code>:&quot;foo bar&quot;</code> for writing a symbol. You can then define a method based on that even though it has spaces in the method name.</p>
<p>My text editor<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://caiustheory.com/feed.xml#fn:2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> also autocompletes ruby symbols from partial matches, which makes it easy to write out what I want in the scenario, run the spec and find out what methods need defining, then define the methods using autocomplete to save copy/pasting everything.</p>
<p>By using actual methods for these, we get a couple of other happy accidents along the way. Most ruby installs now include <a href="https://github.com/ruby/did_you_mean">did_you_mean</a> out the box, which suggests methods like the one you called if your method results in a <code>NoMethodError</code>. This works quite nicely, you end up with something like</p>
<pre><code>undefined method `When I pblish a new post' for #&lt;RSpec::ExampleGroups::AdminPosts:0x00007faf1f9fc4c0&gt;
Did you mean? When I publish a new post
</code></pre><p>And then if you just run it without implementing any of the helper methods at all, you get a nice <code>NoMethodError</code> telling you exactly what you need to implement:</p>
<pre><code>NoMethodError:
undefined method `Given I am logged in as an admin' for #&lt;RSpec::ExampleGroups::AdminPosts:0x00007fbd06598498&gt;
</code></pre><p>The magic behind that makes all this work is in <a href="https://gist.github.com/caius/606b80252b176e353fe0893f8888dbbf"><code>spec/support/given_when_then.rb</code></a>, which is not terrible, but also probably not a great idea. 🙃</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Generating guitar chords is <a href="https://www.gloriousvoiceleader.com/">my thing</a>. Over the years I’ve written <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/glorious_voice_leader">thousands</a> of <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/chord">lines</a> of <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/chord_namer">code</a> and <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/tags/#music">even more words</a> all dedicated to the process of algorithmically generating and recommending guitar chords. In the spirit of generation, let’s throw another language and another few hundred additional words onto that stack!</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a> is a logic-based programming language that, <a href="http://www.learnprolognow.org/">as I’m learning</a> (disclaimer: I’m very new to Prolog), excels at representing logical relationships between data. The guitar fretboard is a never-ending landscape of interesting relationships ripe for exploration, so Prolog seems like a valuable tool to have at our arsenal as fretboard explorers.</p>

<p>Let’s see how we can use it.</p>

<h2 id="the-magic-of-prolog">The Magic of Prolog</h2>

<p>One of the most mind blowing aspects of Prolog, from the perspective of someone new to the language, is the fluidity and ambiguity of inputs and outputs to “predicates” (think of them as functions).</p>

<p>For example, we can ask the built-in <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=member/2"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">member</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code></a> predicate if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">1</span></code> is a member of the list <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">]</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
member(1, [1, 2, 3]).
</code></pre>

<p>And Prolog will tell us that yes, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">1</span></code> is a member of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">]</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
true.
</code></pre>

<p>We can also bind the first argument of our call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">member</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> to a variable, and Prolog will happily report all possible values of that variable for which the predicate holds true:</p>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
member(X, [1, 2, 3]).
</code></pre>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
X = 1 ;
X = 2 ;
X = 3.
</code></pre>

<p>When the second argument of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">member</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">]</span></code>, the first argument can either be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">1</span></code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">2</span></code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">3</span></code>.</p>

<p>But we can take things even further. We can bind the second argument of our call to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">member</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> predicate to a variable and ask Prolog for all of the lists that contain our first argument, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">1</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
member(1, X).
</code></pre>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
X = [1|_5982] ;
X = [_5980, 1|_5988] ;
X = [_5980, _5986, 1|_5994] ;
X = [_5980, _5986, _5992, 1|_6000] ...
</code></pre>

<p>This implementation of the Prolog runtime (<a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/">SWI-Prolog 8.0.3</a>) represents unbound variables with leading underscores. So the first possible value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nv">X</span></code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">1</span></code> prepended to any other list. Another possible value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nv">X</span></code> is some value prepended to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">1</span></code>, prepended to any other list. And so on, <em>forever.</em></p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">member</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> predicate simply defines the relationship between it’s two arguments. If one of those arguments is omitted, it can be recovered by applying or reversing that relationship appropriately.</p>

<p>Is your mind blown yet?</p>

<h2 id="chordal-relationships">Chordal Relationships</h2>

<p>Let’s write a predicate that accepts a few arguments that describes our guitar’s fretboard in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_tunings">tuning</a> and number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fret">frets</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_letters#Chord_quality">the quality of the chord</a> we’re looking for, and the notes of a specific chord voicing given as string/fret tuples. Our predicate will either confirm or deny that the notes given live within the bounds of the fretboard and accurately depict the desired chord quality.</p>

<p>For example, on a normal guitar tuned to standard tuning, we could ask if fret <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">3</span></code> played on string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">1</span></code> (starting from the lowest string), fret <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">2</span></code> played on string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">2</span></code> and the open fret played on string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">3</span></code> constitute a C major (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">7</span><span class="p">]</span></code>) chord voicing:</p>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
voicing([[0,40], [1,45], [2,50], [3,55], [4,59], [5,64]],
        18,
        [0, 4, 7],
        [[1, 3], [2, 2], [3, 0]]).
</code></pre>

<p>And the answer is yes, they do:</p>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
true.
</code></pre>

<p>If we assume that both our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nv">Tuning</span></code> array and the final <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nv">Voicing</span></code> array are sorted in terms of string number we can build our predicate with a simple walk across the strings, analyzing each note in the chord along the way.</p>

<p>For every string on the fretboard, we first check that a note in our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nv">Voicing</span></code> lives on that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nv">String</span></code>. If it does, we need to make sure that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nv">Fret</span></code> being played on that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nv">String</span></code> is <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=between/3"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">between</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code></a> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code> and the number of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nv">Frets</span></code> on the fretboard. Next, we calculate the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nv">Pitch</span></code> of the fretted note and verify that it’s a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">member</span></code> of the chord <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nv">Quality</span></code> we’re checking for. Lastly we remove that pitch from the set of qualities, and recurse to check the rest of the strings and remaining notes in our chord voicing:</p>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
voicing([[String,Open]|Tuning], Frets, Quality, [[String,Fret]|Voicing]) :-
  between(0,Frets,Fret),
  Pitch is (Open + Fret) mod 12,
  member(Pitch, Quality),
  subtract(Quality, [Pitch], RemainingQuality),
  voicing(Tuning, Frets, RemainingQuality, Voicing).
</code></pre>

<p>If a string isn’t being played as part of the given chord voicing, we can simply move on to check the next string on the fretboard:</p>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
voicing([_|Tuning], Frets, Quality, Voicing) :-
  voicing(Tuning, Frets, Quality, Voicing).
</code></pre>

<p>Eventually, we’ll run out of strings to check. In that case, if the remaining set of notes in the chord voicing and the remaining set of pitches in our chord quality are both empty, we can say with confidence that the given set of notes is a valid voicing of the specified chord quality:</p>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
voicing([], _, [], []).
</code></pre>

<p>If we run out of strings and we’re still looking for either notes in the voicing, or pitches in the quality, we know that something has gone wrong, and the chord we’re looking at isn’t a valid voicing.</p>

<p>Altogether, our complete <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">voicing</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">4</span></code> predicate looks like this:</p>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
voicing([], _, [], []).

voicing([_|Tuning], Frets, Quality, Voicing) :-
  voicing(Tuning, Frets, Quality, Voicing).

voicing([[String,Open]|Tuning], Frets, Quality, [[String,Fret]|Voicing]) :-
  between(0,Frets,Fret),
  Pitch is (Open + Fret) mod 12,
  member(Pitch, Quality),
  subtract(Quality, [Pitch], RemainingQuality),
  voicing(Tuning, Frets, RemainingQuality, Voicing).
</code></pre>

<p>We can write a helper predicate that assumes an eighteen fret guitar in standard tuning:</p>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
voicing(Quality, Voicing) :-
  voicing([[0,40], [1,45], [2,50], [3,55], [4,59], [5,64]],
          18,
          Quality,
          Voicing).
</code></pre>

<p>We can use our new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">voicing</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">4</span></code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">voicing</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> predicates to ask whether a certain set of notes played on the fretboard are a valid C major voicing:</p>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
voicing([0, 4, 7], [[1, 3], [2, 2], [3, 0]]).
</code></pre>

<p>And Prolog happily tells us that it is a valid voicing!</p>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
true.
</code></pre>

<p>Excellent.</p>

<h2 id="reversing-the-relationship">Reversing the Relationship</h2>

<p>We’ve seen that we can use our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">voicing</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">4</span></code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">voicing</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> predicate to check if a given set of notes on the fretboard are a valid voicing for a given chord quality. For example, we can ask if the notes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">[[</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">5</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="m">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">5</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="m">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">4</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="m">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">6</span><span class="p">]]</span></code> represent a G7 (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">]</span></code>) chord voicing, and our Prolog program will confirm that they do.</p>

<p>But what else can we do? We were promised exploration!</p>

<p>Our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">voicing</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">4</span></code> implementation didn’t explicitly lay out the steps for constructing a chord voicing of a given quality, but it did define the relationships between a fretboard configuration, the quality of the chord we’re looking for, and the notes in a given chord voicing. Just like we reversed the relationships in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">member</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> to construct all possible lists containing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">1</span></code>, we can reverse the relationships defined in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">voicing</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">4</span></code> and find all possible voicings of a given chord quality!</p>

<p>All we have to do is leave the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nv">Voicing</span></code> argument unbound when we call our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">voicing</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> predicate, and Prolog will reverse the relationship and spit out every possible voicing of our G7 chord spread across out fretboard:</p>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
voicing([5, 9, 0, 3], Voicing).
</code></pre>

<pre class="language-prolog"><code class="language-prolog">
Voicing = [[2, 1], [3, 2], [4, 1], [5, 1]] ;
Voicing = [[2, 1], [3, 2], [4, 1], [5, 13]] ;
Voicing = [[2, 1], [3, 2], [4, 6], [5, 8]] ...
</code></pre>

<p>Awesome! This is basically the heart of <a href="https://www.gloriousvoiceleader.com/">Glorious Voice Leader</a> compressed into ten lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>

<p>We should be able to dig deeper into these relationships. In theory, we should be able to leave the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nv">Quality</span></code> off of our call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">voicing</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> and Prolog should tell us all of the possible qualities a given set of notes could be interpreted as.</p>

<p>Similarly, we should be able to leave the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nv">Tuning</span></code> argument unbound, and Prolog should give us all of the possible tunings that would give us the given type of chord with the given voicing.</p>

<p>Both of these types of query sound extremely useful and interesting for someone exploring their fretboard and trying to deepen their understanding of the guitar, but they’re infeasible with my current implementation of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">voicing</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">4</span></code> predicate. If we try either of them, Prolog will think forever and never give us an answer. If we <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=debugger">trace</a> through the execution we’ll see an enormous amount of time being wasted on inevitably doomed partial solutions.</p>

<p>If I were a better Prologger, I’m sure I could implement a version of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">voicing</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">4</span></code> predicate that could give us these answers, but I’m just not there yet. Consider it future work.</p></div>

<span class="date">April 21, 2020 12:00 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>While everyone is writing about remote meetings these days, I do not believe that successful remote meetings are actually meaningfully different from successful in-person meetings.<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I’m glossing over videoconferencing because I don’t believe it is a meaningful hurdle to clear.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://twitchard.github.io/posts/2020-03-28-against-process.html">Like many other developers</a>, I loathe meetings, especially when they seem like a waste of valuable time. My philosophy is “if you have to set up a meeting, at least do it right”. Consequently, here are some rules for successful meetings, both remote and in-person:</p>
<h2 id="the-best-meeting-is-no-meeting">The Best Meeting Is No Meeting</h2>
<p>It is important to understand the tradeoffs involved when deciding to schedule a meeting. Meetings are synchronous discussions, which makes them useful for knowledge exchanges and decision making processes, but they are also time-intensive and disruptive for everyone involved.</p>
<p>The alternative to organising a meeting is an asynchronous conversation, for example on a shared document.<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I find that doing all the same work as for a meeting on a shared document, but just leaving out the actual meeting, is a very effective way of using asynchronous process.<br />
<br />
</span></span> This can be faster than a meeting overall, as it allows participants to participate in their own time, instead of trying to find a slot that fits everyone. In addition to that, it is much less disruptive compared scheduling a meeting, especially for <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/changing-software-development/9780470515044/9780470515044_software_developers_are_knowledge_worker.html">knowledge workers</a>.</p>
<p>The only good reason for a synchronous meeting is making decisions requiring knowledge exchange and/or consensus. A good example would be planning a complicated feature, or cleaning up a backlog.</p>
<h2 id="the-most-important-work-happens-before-the-meeting">The Most Important Work Happens Before the Meeting</h2>
<p>Every meeting needs an organiser. The organiser needs to define the expected outcome of the meeting, as well as gather all required information, and share all of these in the meeting agenda. The outcome should be tangible, like a decision or a set of tasks to be done.</p>
<p>The agenda is crucial, because the participants will likely have to do some preparation in advance to the meeting. If any specific work needs to be done before the meeting, like research or data retrieval, make sure to clearly assign tasks.</p>
<p>I recommend writing out the full agenda before scheduling the meeting, and then sharing the agenda with the calendar invitation. This allows everyone to schedule their preparation in their own time.</p>
<h2 id="the-actual-meeting">The Actual Meeting</h2>
<p>During the meeting it is important to keep notes, usually in a shared document. You can designate a scribe, or just agree to all contribute some bullet points whenever possible.<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Both approaches have pros and cons. A dedicated scribe leads to more detailed and coherent notes, but requires a person who will not be able to take part in the conversation, at least not effectively.<br />
<br />
</span></span> You want to write down any conclusions reached, important points made, and further questions and future work to be done. Do not care too much about form, the meeting organiser should rewrite the notes after the meeting anyway.</p>
<p>The meeting is prime talking time, and you should treat it as such. Do not spend time watching someone carry out a task.<span><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">There is really no point in everyone watching a single person manipulate a JIRA board during a meeting.<br />
<br />
</span></span> If you find during the meeting that you require more information, write this down as a future task instead of derailing the meeting.</p>
<p>The organiser should always work towards the defined outcome, but it often happens that some other discussion emerges as a precondition to reaching the outcome. There is a balance to be struck between discussion necessary to get to a meaningful outcome and veering too far off-topic.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the time slot scheduled is more a rough guideline than a rule. If you can finish early, do so. If you need more time, and everyone involved has more time, take it.<span><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Though maybe take a 5 minute break.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Do not try to force an outcome if you did not get there in time. If you find at the start of the meeting that some necessary precondition has not been met do not be afraid to reschedule or cancel altogether.</p>
<h2 id="the-alternative-the-ad-hoc-huddle">The Alternative: The Ad Hoc Huddle</h2>
<p>The rules above do not mean that you cannot talk to one another without ritual. Especially for small discussions between 2-4 people, ad hoc huddles can be useful.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, these should usually be happening within the next 24 hours, so usually “later today” or “tomorrow morning”.</p>
<p>You still need to define a goal, and you will want to write down any outcomes in some form, even if less formal than meeting notes. Even a Slack message with some findings in a relevant channel counts.</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Predicting the peak of data fitted by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logistic equation</a> is attracting a lot of attention at the moment.  Let&#8217;s see how well we can predict the final size of a software system, in lines of code, using logistic regression (<a href="http://www.coding-guidelines.com/code-data/logistic-predict.tgz">code+data</a>).</p>
<p>First up is the size of the GNU C library.  This is not really a good test, since the peak (or rather a peak) has been reached.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.coding-guidelines.com/images/glibc_evo.png" alt="Growth of glibc, in lines,, with logistic regression fit" /></p>
<p>We need a system that has not yet reached an easily recognizable peak.  The Linux kernel has been under development for many years, and lots of LOC counts are available.  The plot below shows a logistic equation fitted to the kernel data, assuming that the only available data was up to day: 2,900, 3,650, 4,200, and 5,000+.  Can you tell which fitted line corresponds to which number of days?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.coding-guidelines.com/images/linux-logistic-fut.png" alt="Number lines in Linux kernel, on days since release1, and four fitted logistic regression models." /></p>
<p>The underlying &#8216;problem&#8217; is that we are telling the fitting software to fit a particular equation; the software does what it has been told to do, and fits a logistic equation (in this case).</p>
<p>A cubic polynomial is also a great fit to the existing kernel data (red line to the left of the blue line), and this fitted equation can be extended into future (to the right of the blue line); dotted lines are 95% confidence bounds.  Do any readers believe the future size of the Linux kernel predicted by this cubic model?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.coding-guidelines.com/images/Linux-DAYLOC-pred.png" alt="Number of distinct silhouettes for a function containing four statements" /></p>
<p>Predicting the future requires lots of data on the underlying processes that drive events.  Modeling events is an iterative process.  Build a model, check against reality, adjust model, rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>If the COVID-19 experience trains people to be suspicious of future predictions made by models, it will have done something positive.</p></div>

<p><em>Huang et. al., HotOS 2017</em> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/paper-1.pdf">&ldquo;Gray Failure: The Achilles Heel of Cloud-Scale Systems&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>Detecting faults in a large system is a surprisingly hard problem. First you have to decide what kind of thing you want to measure, or &lsquo;observe&rsquo;. Then you have to decide what pattern in that observation constitutes a sufficiently worrying situation (or &lsquo;failure&rsquo;) to require mitigation. Then you have to decide how to mitigate it!</p>

<p>Complicating this already difficult issue is the fact that the health of your system is in part a matter of perspective. Your service might be working wonderfully from inside your datacenter, where your probes are run, but all of that means nothing to your users who have been trying to get their RPCs through an overwhelmed firewall for the last hour.</p>

<p>That gap, between what your failure detectors observe, and what clients observe, is the subject of this paper on &lsquo;Gray Failures&rsquo;, which are the failure modes that happen when clients perceive an issue that is not yet detected by your internal systems. This is a good name for an old phenomenon (every failure detector I have built includes client-side mitigations to work around this exact issue).</p>

<h4><a href="http://bluishcoder.co.nz/2020/04/18/fun-factor-libraries.html">Fun Factor Libraries</a>

<span class="date">April 18, 2020 11:00 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p><a href="https://factorcode.org/">Factor</a> is a programming language I've <a href="http://bluishcoder.co.nz/tags/factor/">written about before</a> and in the early days of Factor development I wrote a number of libraries and contributed to development. It's been a while since I've contributed but I still use Factor. The development environment has a very Smalltalk-like feel to it and it includes full documentation and browseable source code of libraries.</p>

<p>This post isn't about Factor the language, but is about some of the neat fun libraries that people have written that shows off the graphical development system a bit.</p>

<h2>Minesweeper</h2>

<p>The first example is an implementation of the game Minesweeper in Factor. A <a href="https://re-factor.blogspot.com/2018/02/minesweeper.html">blog post by the author</a> explains the implementation. To run it inside Factor, do the following:</p>

<pre><code>"minesweeper" run
</code></pre>

<p>A new window will open showing the game. Help can be shown with:</p>

<pre><code>"minesweeper" help
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://bluishcoder.co.nz/factor/factor_minesweeper.gif" /></p>

<h2>XKCD</h2>

<p>Another fun example is displaying XKCD comics inside the Factor REPL. The <a href="http://re-factor.blogspot.com/2011/04/xkcd.html">implementation is explained by the author here</a>.</p>

<pre><code>USE: xkcd
latest-xkcd.
...comic displayed here...
random-xkcd.
...comic displayed here...
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://bluishcoder.co.nz/factor/factor_xkcd.gif" /></p>

<h2>Wikipedia</h2>

<p>If it seems like all the examples I'm using are from the excellent re-factor blog - well, most of them are. This blog post from re-factor <a href="https://re-factor.blogspot.com/2012/12/today-in-history.html">shows pulling historical facts from Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<pre><code>USE: wikipedia
USE: calendar

today historical-events.
...a list of historical events from wikipedia for today...

yesterday historical-births.
...a list of historical births from wikipedia for yesterday...

5 weeks ago historical-deaths.
...a list of historical deaths from wikipedia for five weeks ago...
</code></pre>

<p>The items in the list are graphical elements that can be manipulated. Left clicking on the coloured words will open a URL in the default web browser. Right clicking allows you to push the element on the Factor stack and manipulate it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-calendar.html">calendar vocab</a> has a lot of interesting words that allow doing calculations like "5 weeks ago".</p>

<p><img src="http://bluishcoder.co.nz/factor/factor_wikipedia.gif" /></p>

<h2>Hacker News</h2>

<p>There's a <a href="https://docs.factorcode.org/content/vocab-hacker-news.html">hacker-news</a> vocabulary that provides words to list current articles on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> website. Like the previous Wikipedia example, the graphical elements are clickable objects:</p>

<pre><code>USE: hacker-news

hacker-news-top.
...list of top articles...

hacker-news-show.
...list articles related to showing projects...
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://bluishcoder.co.nz/factor/factor_hackernews.gif" /></p>

<h2>CPU 8080 Emulator</h2>

<p>A number of years ago I wrote a CPU 8080 emulator in Factor and used this to implement a <a href="http://bluishcoder.co.nz/2007/05/12/factor-space-invaders-updated.html">Space Invaders Emulator</a> and then emulators for a couple of other 8080 arcade games, Balloon Bomber and Lunar Rescue. These examples require the original arcade ROMs and instructions for using them are in the online help:</p>

<pre><code>"rom.space-invaders" run
...opens in a new window...
"rom.balloon-bomber" run
...opens in a new window...
"rom.lunar-rescue" run
...opens in a new window...

"rom.space-invaders" help
...displays help...
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://bluishcoder.co.nz/factor/factor_cpu8080.gif" /></p>

<h2>Gopher Implementation</h2>

<p>Another magical implementation from the re-factor blog, a <a href="https://re-factor.blogspot.com/2016/10/gopher-server.html">Gopher server</a> and a <a href="http://re-factor.blogspot.com/2014/12/gopher.html">graphical Gopher Client</a>. This is a video I made of the gopher client on YouTube:</p>




<p>I also did a video that shows some Factor development tools on the running Gopher client to show how everything is live in Factor:</p>




<h2>And More</h2>

<p>There's much more buried inside Factor. The <a href="https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-handbook-library-reference.html">list of articles</a> and <a href="https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-vocab-index.html">list of vocabularies</a> from the online help is a good way to explore. This help system is also available offline in a Factor install. By default many libraries aren't loaded when Factor starts but you can force loading everything using <code>load-all</code>:</p>

<pre><code>load-all
...all vocabs are loaded - prepare to wait for a while...
save
...saves the image so when factor is restarted the vocabs remain loaded...
</code></pre>

<p>The benefit of doing this while developing is all the online help, source and words are available via the inbuilt tools like "apropos", "usage", etc.</p></div>

<h4><a href="https://blog.ovalerio.net/archives/1861">Django Friday Tips: Feature Flags</a>

<span class="date">April 17, 2020 07:49 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>This time, as you can deduce from the title, I will address the topic of how to use feature flags on Django websites and applications.  This is an incredible functionality to have, specially if you need to continuously roll new code to production environments that might not be ready to be released.</p>



<p>But first what are Feature Flags? The Wikipedia tells us this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A feature toggle (also feature switch, feature flag, &#8230;) is a technique in software development that attempts to provide an alternative to maintaining multiple branches in source code (known as feature branches), such that a software feature can be tested even before it is completed and ready for release. Feature toggle is used to hide, enable or disable the feature during runtime. </p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>It seems a pretty clear explanation and it gives us a glimpse of the potential of having this capability in a given project. Exploring the concept a bit more it uncovers a nice set of possibilities and use cases, such as:</p>



<ul><li>Canary Releases</li><li>Instant Rollbacks</li><li>AB Testing</li><li>Testing features with production data</li></ul>



<p>To dive further into the concept I recommend starting by reading <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html">this article</a>, that gives you a very detailed explanation of the overall idea.  </p>



<p>In the rest of the post I will describe how this kind of functionality can easily be included in a standard Django application. Overtime <a href="https://djangopackages.org/grids/g/feature-flip/">many packages</a> were built to solve this problem however most <a href="https://github.com/disqus/gargoyle/">aren&#8217;t</a> <a href="https://github.com/disqus/gutter">maintained</a> anymore, so for this post I picked <a href="https://github.com/django-waffle/django-waffle">django-waffle</a> given it&#8217;s one of the few that are still in active development.</p>



<p>As an example scenario lets image a company that provides a suite of online office tools and is currently in the process of introducing a new product while redoing the main website&#8217;s design. The team wants some trusted users and the developers to have access to the unfinished product in production and a small group of random users to view the new design.</p>



<p>With the above scenario in mind, we start by install the package and adding it to our project by following the instructions present on the official documentation. </p>



<p>Now picking the <code>/products</code> page that is supposed to displays the list of existing products, we can implement it this way:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># views.py
from django.shortcuts import render

from waffle import flag_is_active


def products(request):
    if flag_is_active(request, "new-design"):
        return render(request, "new-design/product_list.html")
    else:
        return render(request, "product_list.html")</code></pre>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># templates/products.html
{% load waffle_tags %}

&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
&lt;head>
    &lt;title>Available Products&lt;/title>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
    &lt;ul>
        &lt;li>&lt;a href="/spreadsheets">Spreadsheet&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
        &lt;li>&lt;a href="/presentations">Presentation&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
        &lt;li>&lt;a href="/chat">Chat&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
        &lt;li>&lt;a href="/emails">Marketing emails&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
        {% flag "document-manager" %}
            &lt;li>&lt;a href="/documents">&lt;/a>Document manager&lt;/li>
        {% endflag %}
    &lt;/ul>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html></code></pre>



<p>You can see above that 2 conditions are checked while processing a given request. These conditions are the flags, which are models on the database with certain criteria that will be evaluated against the provided request in order to determine if they are active or not.</p>



<p>Now on the database we can config the behavior of this code by editing the flag objects. Here are the two objects that I created (retrieved using the <code>dumpdata</code> command): </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>  {
    "model": "waffle.flag",
    "pk": 1,
    "fields": {
      "name": "new-design",
      "everyone": null,
      "percent": "2.0",
      "testing": false,
      "superusers": false,
      "staff": false,
      "authenticated": false,
      "languages": "",
      "rollout": false,
      "note": "",
      "created": "2020-04-17T18:41:31Z",
      "modified": "2020-04-17T18:51:10.383Z",
      "groups": &#91;],
      "users": &#91;]
    }
  },
  {
    "model": "waffle.flag",
    "pk": 2,
    "fields": {
      "name": "document-manager",
      "everyone": null,
      "percent": null,
      "testing": false,
      "superusers": true,
      "staff": false,
      "authenticated": false,
      "languages": "",
      "rollout": false,
      "note": "",
      "created": "2020-04-17T18:43:27Z",
      "modified": "2020-04-17T19:02:31.762Z",
      "groups": &#91;
        1,  # Dev Team
        2   # Beta Customers
      ],
      "users": &#91;]
    }
  }</code></pre>



<p>So in this case <code>new-design</code> is available to 2% of the users and <code>document-manager</code> only for the <code>Dev Team</code> and <code>Beta Customers</code> user groups.</p>



<p>And for today this is it.</p></div>

COBOL is in the news again. Millions of people are filing unemployment claims nearly all at once, and the systems to process them are failing. Why? They need to scale to unprecedented levels, they&rsquo;re written in COBOL, and&hellip; we don&rsquo;t have enough COBOL programmers.

Most COBOL programmers are retired. The pipeline of new COBOL programmers is nearly nonexistent. Many are coming out of retirement just to help.</div>

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2020/04/16/clapping-music-with-tidalcycles/">Clapping Music with TidalCycles</a>

<span class="date">April 16, 2020 12:00 AM</span>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I’m always looking for ways of making music with my computer that feels natural to me and fits with my mental model of music creation. As part of that search, I decided to try learning <a href="https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Welcome">TidalCycles</a>. Tidal is a language embedded into Haskell and designed to write and manipulate patterns to create music.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Tutorial">getting set up</a> and tinkering for a bit, I decided to try using Tidal to create an intentional piece of music. Tidal’s focus on patterns made me think of another musician obsessed with patterns and repetition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich">Steve Reich</a>. That connection planted a seed in my mind, and I decided to try recreating Steve Reich’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapping_Music"><em>Clapping Music</em></a> with Tidal:</p>



<p>The meat of my implementation is in these three statements that describe the shifting rhythm:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">
repeatCycles 4
$ iter "12"
$ n "0 0 0 ~ 0 0 ~ 0 ~ 0 0 ~"
</code></pre>

<p>We start with our base pattern (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">n</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">0 0 0 ~ 0 0 ~ 0 ~ 0 0 ~</span><span class="dl">"</span></code>). Next, we use <a href="https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/iter"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">iter</span></code></a> to split that pattern into the twelve variations we’ll play throughout the piece. However, we want to repeat each variation for some number of cycles before moving onto the next. It turns out that <a href="https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/repeatCycles"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">repeatCycles</span></code></a> is a nice way of accomplishing this. We repeat each variation for four cycles before moving onto the next.</p>

<p>Because we’re repeating each variation of our pattern for four cycles, we’ll want to use <a href="https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/seqP"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">seqP</span></code></a> to sequence <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="mi">13</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">4</span></code> cycles of both rhythms to start and end our piece in unison:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">
seqP [
  (
    0,
    13 * 4,
    ...
  ),
  (
    0,
    13 * 4,
    ...
  )
]
</code></pre>

<p>When using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">seqP</span></code>, it’s important to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">resetCycles</span></code> to make sure we start on cycle <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="mi">0</span></code>.</p>

<p>And that’s all there is to it! It’s simple in hindsight, but I spent quite a while figuring this out, and learned from many mistakes along the way. The end result was worth it. Rock on, Steve Reich.</p></div>

<h4><a href="https://j11g.com/2020/04/15/ten-pieces-of-software-that-removed-roadblocks/">Ten pieces of software that removed roadblocks</a>

<span class="date">April 15, 2020 02:40 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Successful software is not defined by the number of lines of code or number of clever algorithms. <span>More often than not, successful software is defined by how many roadblocks it removes for the user.</span></p>



<p>Sounds obvious, right? But it usually takes a few iterations before software gains critical mass. And for a (critical) mass number of users, you need to remove roadblocks. Roadblocks that power-users or early adopters don&#8217;t mind dealing with, but for <em>regular </em>users make all the difference.</p>



<p>Here are some examples of software that were not always the first, but did  remove the right roadblocks and cleared the road for the masses.</p>



<h2>Netscape (Mosaic)</h2>



<p>Netscape is probably the most classic example of this. You already had the internet and the World Wide Web. And you had Gopher, FTP and SMTP and the likes. But critical mass? You needed something much simpler! Something that didn&#8217;t require typing in difficult commands after connecting to some remote server. But a graphical user interface where you could just point and click*. That&#8217;s what really brought the masses to the World Wide Web. </p>



<p><em>(*You could argue that Windows 95 did exactly the same, eleven years after the Mac did it).</em></p>



<h2>VLC</h2>



<p>Remember when you had to download specific video codecs for your media player? I do and trust me you don&#8217;t want to do that. VLC was like a breath of fresh air because it took care of all that stuff.</p>



<p>VLC was not the first (or last) desktop video player. But it was the first that bundled all codecs and made sure you could pretty much throw every imaginable video format at it, and it would just play it! It removed that roadblock.</p>



<h2>YouTube</h2>



<p>Remember emailing videos? Sure that might work. But how can you be sure the receiver has the right codec (see above)? Or that the receiving email provider won&#8217;t mark the video as spam or too big for email? YouTube completely removed all barriers for <strong>uploading</strong>, <strong>sharing </strong>and <strong>viewing </strong>videos online in one go. Just from the browser and without a subscription. A lot of roadblocks: gone.</p>



<h2>Spotify</h2>



<p>CDs were already a thing of the past. But downloading, paying for and managing individual songs was still a lot of work. Spotify managed to figure this one out, and it turned out this is actually what a lot of people wanted. <strong>Every </strong>song available, at all times for a fixed fee? Talk about removing roadblocks.</p>



<h2>WhatsApp</h2>



<p>WhatsApp was not the first or only IM/chat software, not even by a long shot. So why did it succeed (in most parts of the world) as the number one smartphone chat app? Because they removed multiple roadblocks.</p>



<p>Early on WhatsApp put a lot of time and effort in making sure their software worked on <strong>any</strong> kind of cellphone, and specifically older, less powerful phones. Remember they offered a Java ME version? Because they understood chat is not a one-way street. It only works when everyone involved has the same access. Founder Jan Koum learned this from personal experience when trying to chat with family on the other side of the world on shabby internet connections. </p>



<p>And he and co-founder Brian Acton even <a href="https://qz.com/184850/why-whatsapps-founders-still-carry-old-nokia-phones/">carried around old phones</a> for a long time. For this exact reason.</p>



<h2>Slack</h2>



<p>I never had a need for Slack (I&#8217;ve been using IRC for over 20 years), but I can clearly see what they did: they removed roadblocks. </p>



<p>While still offering pretty much the same core functionality as IRC offers: <strong>persistent group chat</strong> (emphasis on persistent). But: without the need of choosing servers, or setting up proxies or using intimidating software and all that other difficult stuff. They took care of all that. Oh, and you can share animated gifs.</p>



<h2>iPhone</h2>



<p>The iPhone is an amalgamation of hard- and software. But it probably belongs on this list, for all the same reasons. It was not the first smartphone, but it was the first that did everything right and it didn&#8217;t feel second grade (hardware and software wise). Before the iPhone there where many different smartphones in every shape and form, after the iPhone every smartphone looked like the iPhone. That should tell you something. </p>



<h2>Zoom</h2>



<p>I have personally never used Zoom, and from what I learned I probably won&#8217;t any time soon. But I can clearly see what&#8217;s happening here. All the (dirty) tricks they did with the <a href="https://twitter.com/c1truz_/status/1244737672930824193">installer</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sytses/status/1246903647503405057">audio-stack</a>: it is all about removing roadblocks. You can (and should be) critical of these kinds of tricks, but you can&#8217;t deny it made them the current go to app for video group chat, leaving Skype and the likes in the dust. </p>



<p><em>(I also think they have the best/easiest to remember name. That probably also helps. I could see it becoming a verb.)</em></p>



<h2>C programming language</h2>



<p>I maybe going out on a limb here, but I think C&#8217;s portability is undeniably a large factor in the succes of C (among other things). Because C was highly portable, it removed many roadblocks for the years ahead where many different hardware platforms all needed a higher level language but did not want to reinvent the wheel. C removed that roadblock and subsequently became a dominant language.</p>



<h2>GPL</h2>



<p>Entering dodgy terrain here. Not actual software, but a license. There are *many* licenses out there. But GPL was one of the first that removed many important roadblocks, about how to share and and distribute software that paved the way for a whole lot of other things. And caused an explosion of software in the 80s and 90s (GCC, GNU/Linux et al.)</p>



<h2>Others?</h2>



<p>These are just some examples but I always like to hear others! What software do you think removed a bunch of roadblocks to pave the way for mass adoption?</p>

<h4><a href="https://j11g.com/2020/04/13/string-theory-david-foster-wallace/">String Theory – David Foster Wallace</a>

<span class="date">April 13, 2020 08:56 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>If you read this blog, you know DFW is one of my favorite writers. I even named my <a href="https://books.j11g.com/">book app</a>, in part, after him. So I <em>could</em> be short about String Theory &#8212; it&#8217;s a absolute pure delight to read &#8212; but, of course, I won&#8217;t.</p>



<img src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1024x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3274" />String Theory &#8211; David Foster Wallace (2016) &#8211; 150 pages



<p>String Theory is a collection of 5 DFW essays about tennis. It mostly covers 90s era tennis &#8212; Sampras and Agassi &#8212; but it closes with 2006 Federer. With DFW&#8217;s untimely death in 2008 I find it rather pleasing that by attending the 2006 Wimbledon final, Wallace got to witness, and write about the phenomenon that Federer is. And writing this in 2020, it is even more <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aloginn%20federer&src=typed_query&f=live">remarkable</a> that Federer is <em>still</em> playing and competing with the best. Think about that for a second will you.</p>



<p>That said, his piece on Federer is not the best in this collection. But with Wallace that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s bad, because for any other writer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html">such an essay</a> would still be the summit of their writing career. </p>



<p>Though it seems with Federer that Wallace was, understandably, <strong>genuinely</strong> awestruck and smitten in such a way that he finds it hard to describe what makes Federer so special. And that probably says more about Federer&#8217;s remarkable talent than it does about Wallace&#8217;s. </p>



<p>But it is not just that what sets this essay apart from the others for me, but it is that there is less of Wallace <em>himself</em> in this specific piece. His surprised, bemused and bewildered observations of sometimes unrelated random events or encounters, sprinkled trough his essays, either in footnotes or the main body, are what make his writing so enjoyable. You can find this in most essays, but just a little bit less in the Federer one. </p>



<p>Take his complete letdown by the bland biography of famous tennis player Tracy Austin. I find it hilarious because it bothers him so much. Even though that (hilarity) was not the goal.<br />Because, mind you: in the end, even from such a dull an uninspiring sport biography, Wallace manages to ask valid questions about genius and talent and let&#8217;s you know the premise was not to be agitated and write amusingly about that, but to ask questions.</p>



<p>The essay about Michael Joyce might as well be the greatest thing ever written about tennis (or dare I say, <em>sports</em> in general?). It&#8217;s a complex and nuanced, highly technical, hyper personal but still general analysis of what constitutes <em>greatness</em>. He makes you see things with different eyes, while he is learning to see it for himself. Just amazing.</p>



<p>The lack of this personal observations with the Federer essay are a breeding ground for questions. Was this deliberate? Does this mean he was bored with this style? Was it a style? Questions you can endlessly debate. </p>



<p>Fact is never has their been a greater collection of stories about the game of tennis than what you&#8217;ll find in String Theory.</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Consider a language that just contains <em>assignments</em> and <em>if-statements</em> (no <code>else</code> arm).  Nesting level could be used to visualize programs written in such a language; an <code>if</code> represented by an Up step, an <code>assignment</code> by a Level step, and the if-terminator (e.g., the <code>}</code> token) by a Down step.  Silhouettes for the nine possible four line programs are shown in the figure below (image courtesy of Wikipedia).  I use the term silhouette because the obvious terms (e.g., path and trace) have other common usage meanings.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.coding-guidelines.com/images/750px-Motzkin4.png" alt="Number of distinct silhouettes for a function containing four statements" /></p>
<p>How many silhouettes are possible, for a function containing <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_992.5_6e23b400342056acc008d4f7a457458f.png" alt="n" title="n" /> statements?  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motzkin_number">Motzkin numbers</a> provide the answer; the number of silhouettes for functions containing from zero to 20 statements is: 1, 1, 2, 4, 9, 21, 51, 127, 323, 835, 2188, 5798, 15511, 41835, 113634, 310572, 853467, 2356779, 6536382, 18199284, 50852019.  The recurrence relation for Motzkin numbers is (where <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_992.5_6e23b400342056acc008d4f7a457458f.png" alt="n" title="n" /> is the total number of steps, i.e., statements):</p>
<p><img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_984_5be28f9aa8dcd71d99316e5874dcf9dc.png" alt="(n+2)m_n = (2n+1)m_{n-1}+3(n-1)m_{n-2}" title="(n+2)m_n = (2n+1)m_{n-1}+3(n-1)m_{n-2}" /></p>
<p>Human written code contains recurring patterns; the probability of encountering an <em>if-statement</em>, when reading code, is around 17% (at least for the <a href="http://knosof.co.uk/cbook/">C source of some desktop applications</a>).  What does an upward probability of 17% do to the Motzkin recurrence relation?  For many years I have been keeping my eyes open for possible answers (solving the number theory involved is well above my mathematics pay grade).  A few days ago I discovered weighted Motzkin paths.</p>
<p>A weighted Motzkin path is one where the Up, Level and Down steps each have distinct weights.  The  <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL8/Woan/woan11.html">recurrence relationship for weighted Motzkin paths</a> is expressed in terms of number of colored steps, where: <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_992.5_174973952858d4c4c8981e4466d6688f.png" alt="l" title="l" /> is the number of possible colors for the Level steps, and <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_992.5_facb303d3a998c2f7f7b2551e7446c38.png" alt="d" title="d" /> is the number of possible colors for Down steps; Up steps are assumed to have a single color:</p>
<p><img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_981_36ed1881b3d9c82ce216e7a314f60f68.png" alt="(n+2)m_n = d(2n+1)m_{n-1}+(4c-d^2)(n-1)m_{n-2}" title="(n+2)m_n = d(2n+1)m_{n-1}+(4c-d^2)(n-1)m_{n-2}" /></p>
<p>setting: <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_992_bbf423002087516ad68d3d2b0b1f476d.png" alt="c=1" title="c=1" /> and <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_992_3c000675410e9859c8615dc6c71e02d9.png" alt="d=1" title="d=1" /> (i.e., all kinds of step have one color) recovers the original relation.</p>
<p>The different colored Level steps might be interpreted as different kinds of non-nesting statement sequences, and the different colored Down steps might be interpreted as different ways of  decreasing nesting by one (e.g., a <code>goto</code> statement).</p>
<p>The connection between weighted Motzkin paths and probability is that the colors can be treated as weights that add up to 1.  Searching on &#8220;weighted Motzkin&#8221; returns the kind of information I had been looking for; it seems that researchers in other fields had already discovered weighted Motzkin paths, and produced some interesting results.</p>
<p>If an automatic source code generator outputs the start of an <code>if</code> statement (i.e., an Up step) with probability <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_992.5_9c8a0632757d66bb9ae533b2d0a7a0fa.png" alt="a" title="a" />, an assignment (i.e., a Level step) with probability <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_992.5_c172a8ce69eede4a9d5041fbe039bfd8.png" alt="b" title="b" />, and terminates the <code>if</code> (i.e., a Down step) with probability <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_992.5_d4e99aaa1f75eb02a66f89dc95ca6e3c.png" alt="c" title="c" />, what is the probability that the function will contain at least <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_992_06edcb7534c4fbccc29c39043cac8cff.png" alt="n-1" title="n-1" /> statements?  The answer, courtesy of applying Motzkin paths in <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Exact%2C-time-independent-estimation-of-clone-size-in-Roshan-Jones/4add104b62846a91880babfc0b6dd31124d6015b">research into clone cell distributions</a>, is:</p>

<p>where: <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_983.5_97d694be2e4f5270611b910891d86b3b.png" alt="C_{2i}" title="C_{2i}" /> is the <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_992_f107739c8961c9f299d3667354efdcc8.png" alt="2i" title="2i" />&#8216;th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number">Catalan number</a>, and that <code>[...]</code> is a truncation; <a href="http://www.coding-guidelines.com/code-data/Motzkin-stmt.R">code for an implementation in R</a>.</p>
<p>In human written code we know that <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_992_c511b3d7772427ef4698e3537c3e6b94.png" alt="a != c" title="a != c" />, because the number of statements in a <em>compound-statement</em> roughly has an exponential distribution (at least in C).</p>
<p>There has been some work looking at the number of peaks in a Motzkin path, with one <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2661">formula for the total number of peaks in all Motzkin paths of length n</a>.  A formula for the number of paths of length <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_992.5_6e23b400342056acc008d4f7a457458f.png" alt="n" title="n" />, having <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_992.5_816104fe23f930b8f7ea3b0c6c248679.png" alt="k" title="k" /> peaks, would be interesting.</p>
<p>Motzkin numbers have been extended to what is called <em>higher-rank</em>, where Up steps and Level steps can be greater than one.  There are statements that can reduce nesting level by more than one, e.g., <code>break</code>ing out of loops, but no constructs increase nesting by more than one (that I can think of).  Perhaps the <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/On-the-order-of-the-recursion-relation-of-Motzkin-Prodinger/3fb37f5b5ed1c32b4d6378969e33130a6177f95c">rather complicated relationship can be adapted to greater Down steps</a>.</p>
<p>Other kinds of statements can increase nesting level, e.g., <em>for-statements</em> and <em>while-statements</em>.  I have not yet spotted any papers dealing with the case where an Up step eventually has a corresponding Down step at the appropriate nesting level (needed to handle different kinds of nest-creating constructs).  Pointers welcome.  A related problem is handling <em>if-statements</em> containing <code>else</code> arms, here there is an associated increase in nesting. </p>
<p>What characteristics does human written code have that results in it having particular kinds of silhouettes?  I have been thinking about this for a while, but have no good answers.</p>
<p>If you spot any Motzkin related papers that you think could be applied to source code analysis, please let me know.</p></div>

<div class="content">
<div>
        

<p>Continuing my <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2020-04-09-quora-lua-call.html">Quora answers series</a> with <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-explain-the-concept-of-a-class-in-Python-to-a-10-year-old">this question</a> which I answered on June 26, 2012:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How would you explain the concept of a "class" in Python to a 10 year old?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>You cannot distinguish the concept of "class" from the concept of "instance". I think OOP is often taught the wrong way around, paradoxically because it is taught with languages that have support for class-based Object Oriented Programming such as Python (or Java for that matter). So excuse me but I will use another language (Lua, but you don't need to know to understand) to explain it. (Note: this will be <em>bad</em> Lua on purpose, but the point is not to teach Lua, it is to explain OOP).</p>

<p>Since you wrote "to a 10 year old" let's proceed with examples.</p>

<p>Imagine you come from another planet and you do not know what cats are. You encounter something small that purrs. You decide to name it Sam. Later on, you see something else very similar, except it is bigger, and you name it Max.</p>

<p>Let us describe Sam and Max in Lua.</p>

<pre><code>sam = {
    name = "Sam",
    size = "small",
}

max = {
    name = "Max",
    size = "big",
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we said that they purr, so let's define purring:</p>

<pre><code>purr = function(self)
    print(self.name .. " purrs!")
end
</code></pre>

<p><code>purr</code> is a function that has its first argument called <code>self</code> and represents the thing that purrs. For instance you could make Max purr like this:</p>

<pre><code>purr(max)
</code></pre>

<p>Now you could stop here, or you could see purring as a property of Sam and Max. To represent that we could make <code>purr</code> a "method" of the "objects" Sam and Max:</p>

<pre><code>sam.purr = purr
max.purr = purr
</code></pre>

<p>Now with the Lua syntax we cound also make Max purr like this:</p>

<pre><code>max:purr()
</code></pre>

<p>Which is a short way to write this:</p>

<pre><code>max.purr(max)
</code></pre>

<p>Since we said that <code>max.purr = purr</code> it works as expected.</p>

<p>After some time on Earth you realize there are lots of things like Sam and Max. Moreover there are lots of things Sam, Max and their friends do, such as sleep on keyboards. They also have things in common such as the fact they have two eyes.</p>

<p>You grow tired to say: "Max purrs. Max has two eyes. (...). Sam purrs. (...)". It would be much simpler to say give a name to the set of Sam, Max and their friends (for instance "Cats") and say "Cats purr. Cats have two eyes.".</p>

<p>Note that "Cats" is nothing physical, it is an idea, a <em>category</em> you have created for Sam, Max and their friends in order to be able to express things about them in an easier way.</p>

<p>Let's switch to Python to show how this is done now:</p>

<pre><code>class Cat:
    eyes = 2

    def __init__(self, name, size):
        self.name = name
        self.size = size

    def purr(self):
        print(self.name + " purrs!")
</code></pre>

<p>And how you use it:</p>

<pre><code>sam = Cat(name="Sam", size="small")
sam.purr()
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we have never said explicitly that Sam can purr. He can purr because he is a Cat.</p>

<p>In this example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cat is a class, ie. a category of objects ;</p></li>
<li><p>Sam and Max are instances of the Cat class ;</p></li>
<li><p><code>purr</code> is a method of the Cat class, ie. not much more conceptually than a function that takes a Cat instance as its first argument and some syntactic sugar (ie. special notation) to call it.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>By the way, this answer got one of the best comments I ever got on a Quora answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sam and Max are not cats!</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a href="https://j11g.com/2020/04/10/the-trial-franz-kafka/">The Trial – Franz Kafka</a>

<span class="date">April 10, 2020 11:13 AM</span>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Max Brod is probably the worlds&#8217; greatest publicist. He famously refused his writer friends&#8217; dying wish to destroy all his work after his passing.</p>



<p>This friend was of course, Franz Kafka. And against Kafka&#8217;s wishes Max Brod did publish his works and subsequently Kafka became known to the world as an absolute literary genius.</p>



<img src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kafka-The-Trial-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3253" />The Trial &#8211; Franz Kafka (1925) &#8211; 286 pages



<h2>The Trial</h2>



<p>The only other Kafka I read before this was one was <a href="https://books.j11g.com/search.php?id=334">The Metamorphosis</a> and liked it a lot. So I hate to admit it: but I was a bit bored reading The Trial. </p>



<p>The Metamorphosis is more concise, and much more over the top. Which absolutely works. The Trial however, is much tamer.</p>



<p>Sure, I can see what&#8217;s happening and what Kafka is trying to accomplish. And the ideas and underlying themes he&#8217;s playing with. And I really like the dreamlike/nightmarish parallel world Kafka created for the main character. This is of course his well-known watermark: creating these typical Kafkaesque <strong>surreal </strong>settings.  And I thought the doorkeeper story within the story maybe was the most interesting. </p>



<p>Maybe it was my stiff Dutch translation, but overall I had a hard time getting into it. </p>



<h2>Overrated?</h2>



<p>So mr. blogger, you dare to call Kafka overrated? Not exactly, but I cannot let go of the idea that part of the appeal is Kafka&#8217;s elusiveness. </p>



<p>A prolific perfectionist writer who does not want to be published? Who had a very troubled relationship with his abusive father? A writer who died young of malnutrition? A writer who only finds succes after his death? A writer whose books are posthumously (sometimes) scraped together from bits and pieces of scrap paper, so you can forever fawn over the <em>true </em>meaning and interpretation of it?</p>



<p>This is all too much right up the literary world alley.</p>



<p>No doubt The Trial has had great cultural and literary impact. But if you pass this book to someone unbeknownst to all this, I think they might not enjoy it as much as critics tend to think.</p>



<p>Nonetheless these are two pretty good videos explaining what makes Kafka an interesting writer. And I am <strong>still</strong> interested in his other stories. </p>

<h4><a href="https://j11g.com/2020/04/09/cruddiy-a-no-code-bootstrap-crud-generator/">Cruddiy: a no-code Bootstrap CRUD generator</a>

<span class="date">April 09, 2020 07:18 PM</span>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Sometimes you need to give people access to a MySQL database to do some basic tasks. They should be able to Create, Read, Update or Delete database records. And you probably know the user (preferred use-case), but you don&#8217;t want to give them access to phpMyAdmin, which is often too difficult (or let alone give them command line access). But you also don&#8217;t want to handcode the same PHP CRUD pages again!</p>



<p>Now you can use <a href="https://github.com/jan-vandenberg/cruddiy">Cruddiy</a> (CRUD Do It Yourself). To quickly generate clean CRUD pages with <strong>zero code</strong>. </p>



<p>You&#8217;ve probably seen pages like this a <strong>thousand </strong>times before. And now you can make them with a few clicks. </p>



<img src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cruddiy-2020-04-09_20-15-06.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3243" />Pages like this are generated without writing a single line of code. Proper titles, pagination, actions and sorting included.



<p>I got tired of programming the <a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/php-tutorial/php-mysql-crud-application.php">same pages</a> over and over again for some simple database actions. So in classic <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yakshaving</a> fashion I decided to automate this, and built a generator that generates PHP CRUD pages.</p>



<p><strong>Cruddiy is a no-code PHP generator that will generate PHP Bootstrap CRUD pages for your MySQL tables</strong>. </p>



<p>Cruddiy output is an /app folder with everything you need. You can move this folder anywhere and delete Cruddiy if you like.</p>



<p>Most MVC frameworks (e.g. Symfony, <a href="https://j11g.com/2017/11/23/django-in-10-minutes/">Django</a>, Yii2) are also able to generate CRUD pages for you. I have used all of these. But more often than not you end up with 80MB of code (no joke) with all kinds of dependencies that you need to deploy and maintain for just a couple of PHP pages! This rubs me the wrong way. Of course there are many PHP Crud generators around, but they are not <em>libre</em> or built on top other larger frameworks or lacked something else, that I was looking for. So I first and foremost built Cruddiy for myself.</p>



<h2>Goals and characteristics</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Simple</strong><ul><li>No dependencies, just pure PHP (and Bootstrap from CDN).</li><li>Written in PHP and output in PHP. So when the generator runs correctly, your generated app will run correctly.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Clean</strong><ul><li>Just generate what&#8217;s needed, nothing else.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Small</strong><ul><li>If it wasn&#8217;t obvious from the above, the app it generates should be small. Kilobytes not megabytes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Portable</strong><ul><li>Cruddiy generates everything in one single /app folder. You can move this folder anywhere. You don&#8217;t need Cruddiy after generating what you need. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Bootstrap</strong><ul><li>Bootstrap looks clean and is relatively simple and small. I use Bootstrap 3 because I like/know it better than 4. </li></ul></li></ul>



<h2>FAQ</h2>



<h4>Why PHP?</h4>



<ul><li><a href="https://j11g.com/2019/09/17/php-how-did-it-become-so-popular/">Love</a> it or hate it: but PHP is <strong>ubiquitous</strong>. You can download Cruddiy on most webservers and you&#8217;re good to go. <strong>wget <a href="https://github.com/jan-vandenberg/cruddiy/archive/master.zip">the zip</a> -> unpack -> surf to the folder in your browser and follow instructions</strong>.</li><li>Cruddiy is of course a sort of templating engine. It stamps out code based on templates. And if PHP is <em>anything </em>it is in fact by default a template engine itself. So it&#8217;s a pretty good language for this kind of thing. </li></ul>



<h4>Cruddiy does follow not the MVC paradigm!</h4>



<p>Yes, looks elsewhere if you need this. This is not a framework.</p>



<h4>Your code is full of dirty hacks</h4>



<p>I might do quite a bit of array mangling and string replacement, but the PHP pages <strong>Cruddiy</strong> generates are as clean as they come. And when you&#8217;re done generating pages, you can just delete Cruddiy. It completely builds a self-contained portable app that will run on almost any webserver with PHP (i.e. most).</p>



<h4>Your generated code is incomplete</h4>



<p>At the moment what&#8217;s lacking is error value checking on database inserts/updates (all fields are required and it doesn&#8217;t check field types: integers vs dates etc.). These will throw general errors or don&#8217;t do anything at all. I will probably improve this, but for most use-cases (see above) this should not be a problem. The generated code does use prepared statements and should not be vulnerable to SQLi. But hey, <a href="https://github.com/jan-vandenberg/cruddiy/issues">drop</a> me a line if you find something!</p>



<h4>Next features?</h4>



<p>I might add these things:</p>



<ul><li>Darkmode</li><li>Bootstrap 4 theme</li><li>Export to CSV or XLS (users probably want this more often than not)</li><li>Rearrange column order</li><li>Search records (at the top of the page)</li><li>User registration (simple table with username and password: .htaccess  works for now)</li><li>Define table relations (use for cascading deletes etc.)</li><li>More specific field types (ENUM = drop-down list etc.)</li><li>More and better input validation</li><li>Catch more database errors</li></ul>

<div class="content">
<p>Run the following two commands in <strong>bash</strong> to get a listing of all duplicate files (from a directory or location). This can help you clean out duplicate files that sometimes accumulate over time. </p>



<p>The <strong>first </strong>command uses <strong>find</strong> to print <em>all files</em> (and specific attributes) from a specific location to a file, prefixing the size of the file in the name. This way all files with the <strong>same filename</strong> and <strong>same size </strong>can be grouped together.  Which is usually a strong <em>indicator </em>that files are similar.</p>



<p>When you run the <strong>second </strong>command you will get a sorted list of all actual duplicates, <strong>grouped together</strong>. This way, you can quickly pick out similar files and manually choose which ones to keep or delete.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>find . -type f -printf "%s-%f\t %f %c\t %p\n" >> /tmp/findcmd

for i in `sort -n /tmp/findcmd|awk '{print $1}'|uniq -cd|sort -n|awk '{print $2}'`; do grep $i /tmp/findcmd; done</code></pre>



<p>The output will look something like this, you can instantly tell which files are duplicates, based on <strong>size</strong>, <strong>name</strong> and/or <strong>timestamp</strong>.</p>

<h4><a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2020-04-09-quora-lua-call.html">[Quora] What is the call metamethod in Lua?</a>

<span class="date">April 09, 2020 08:40 AM</span>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div>
        

<p>From 2011 to 2014, I used to post answers on <a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>. I don't anymore, because I don't really like what the website has become. I have a copy of some of my answers <a href="http://files.catwell.info/misc/mirror/quora-answers/">here</a> but someone <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-__call-metamethod-in-Lua-and-what-are-some-of-its-uses-and-basic-examples/all_comments/Pierre-Chapuis?__nsrc__=4&__snid3__=7556751152&comment_id=135057589&comment_type=2">commented</a> on one of my answers that it should be available more prominently on the Web, so I decided to repost a few of my answers here, starting with this one.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-__call-metamethod-in-Lua-and-what-are-some-of-its-uses-and-basic-examples/">original question</a> was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm really new to lua and relatively new to programming.,so kindly excuse if I say something stupid.</p>

<p>I have a table named x and its metatable named y. When I have a <code>__call</code> method defined for the metatable <code>y</code>, then I can call <code>x()</code> but if I have a <code>__call</code> for <code>x</code> then I can not call <code>x()</code>.</p>

<p>What is <code>__call</code> used for? How does it work and what are some examples of usage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I answered it on February 25, 2013.</p>

<hr />

<p><code>__call</code> is a metamethod, that means it is meant to be defined in a metatable. A <code>__call</code> field added to a regular table (<code>x</code> in your example) does nothing.</p>

<p>The role of <code>__call</code> is to make something that is not a function (usually a table) act like a function. There are a few reasons why you may want to do that. Here are two examples.</p>

<p>The first one is a memoizing factorial function. In Lua you could write a recursive factorial like this:</p>

<pre><code>local function fact(n)
    if n == 0 then
        return 1
    else
        return n * fact(n - 1)
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note: this is not a good way to write a recursive factorial because you are not taking advantage of tail calls, but it's enough for what I want to explain.</p>

<p>Now imagine your code uses that function to calculate the factorials of numbers from 1 to <code>N</code>. This would be very wasteful since you would calculate the factorial of <code>N</code> once, the factorial of <code>N-1</code> twice, and so on. You would end up computing approximately <code>N²/2</code> factorials.</p>

<p>Instead you could write that:</p>

<pre><code>local fact
fact = setmetatable(
    {[0] = 1},
    {
        __call = function(t, n)
            if not t[n] then
                t[n] = n * fact(n - 1)
            end
            return t[n]
        end
    }
)
</code></pre>

<p>It is an implementation of factorial that memoizes the results it has already computed, which you can call like a function. You can use it exactly like the previous implementation of factorial and get linear complexity.</p>

<p>Another use case for <code>__call</code> is matrices. Imagine you have a matrix implementation that works like that:</p>

<pre><code>local methods = {
    get = function(self, i, j)
        return self[i + 1][j + 1]
    end
}

local mt = {__index = methods}

local new_matrix = function(t)
    return setmetatable(t, mt)
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can use it like that:</p>

<pre><code>local M = new_matrix({ {1, 2}, {3, 4} })
local v = M:get(0, 1)
assert(v == 2)
</code></pre>

<p>However scientists would probably expect something like this:</p>

<pre><code>local v = M(0, 1)
assert(v == 2)
</code></pre>

<p>You can achieve that thanks to <code>__call</code>:</p>

<pre><code>local mt = {
    __index = methods,
    __call = function(self, i, j)
        return self:get(i, j)
    end
}
</code></pre>

I hope this gives you enough information to understand how you can use <code>__call</code>. A word of warning though: like most other metamethods, it is useful but it is important not to abuse it. Simple code is better :)

<p>This article is out of date. Arch Linux <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/62248">stopped shipping OpenSSH with socket activation</a> due to the risk of DoS attack. Now you can just set <code>Port</code> in <code>sshd_config</code> as usual.</p>

<h2 id="original-article">Original article</h2>

<p>I often change the default SSH port from 22 to something else on servers I run. It kind of is a dangerous operation, especially when the only way you have to connect to that server <em>is</em> SSH.</p>

<p>The historical way to do this is editing <code>sshd_config</code> and setting the <code>Port</code> variable, but with recent versions of Arch Linux and the default configuration, this will <em>not</em> work.</p>

<p>The reason is that SSH is configured with systemd socket activation. So what you need to do is run <code>sudo systemctl edit sshd.socket</code> and set the contents of the file to:</p>

<pre><code>[Socket]
ListenStream=MY_PORT
Accept=yes
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>MY_PORT</code> is the port number you want.</p>

I hope this short post will avoid trouble for other people, at least it will be a reminder for me the next time I have to setup an Arch server...

<span class="date">April 05, 2020 08:50 PM</span>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>At the end of March a <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-13-europe-npi-impact/">paper modelling the impact of various scenarios on the spread of COVID-19 infections</a>, by the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/">MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis</a> at Imperial College, appears to have influenced the policy of the powers that be.  This group recently started publishing their <a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/covid19model">modelling code on Github</a> (good for them).</p>
<p>Most of my professional life has been spent analyzing other peoples&#8217; code, for one reason or another (mostly Fortran, then Pascal, and then C).  I had heard that the Imperial software was written in C, but the released code is written in R (as of six hours ago there is the start of a Python version).  Ok, I can work with R, but my comments will be general, since I don&#8217;t have lots of in depth experience reading R code.</p>
<p>The code comes from a research context, and is evolving, i.e., some amount of messiness is to be expected.</p>
<p>There is not a lot of code to talk about (248 lines setting things up, 111 lines for a Stan model, 371 lines of plotting code, and 85 lines of utility code).  The analysis is performed by creating a model using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_(software)">Stan statistical inference language</a> (in which the high level structure of the problem is specified, compiled to a lower level form and then run; the Stan language is very similar to R).  These days lots of problems are coded using a relatively small number of lines that call fancy libraries to do the heavy lifting.  It is becoming rare to have to write tens of thousands of lines of code to solve a problem.</p>
<p>I have two points to make about the code, all designed to reduce the likelihood of mistakes being made by the person working on the source.  These points mainly apply to the Stan code, because that is where the important stuff happens, but are equally applicable to all code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Numeric literals are embedded in the code, values include: <code>2.4</code>, <code>1.0</code>, <code>0.5</code>, <code>0.03</code>, <code>1e-5</code>, and <code>1e-9</code>.  These values obviously mean something to the person who wrote the code, and they can probably be interpreted by experts in the spread of virus infections.  But why are they scattered about the code, rather than appearing together (as a sequence of assignments to variables with meaningful names)?  Having all the constants in one place makes it easier to spot when a mistake has been made, e.g., one value has been changed without a corresponding change in another value; it also makes it easier for people new to the code to figure out what is going on,</li>
<li>when commenting out code, make it very obvious, e.g., have <code>/**********************</code> on its own line, and <code>*****************************/</code> on its own line. Using just <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> makes it easy to miss that code has been commented out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why have they started a Python implementation?  Perhaps somebody on the team is more comfortable working with Python (when deadlines loom, it is always best to go with what you know).</p>
<p>Having both an R and Python version is good, in that coding mistakes are likely to show up as inconsistencies in the results produced.  It&#8217;s always good to have the output of two independently written programs to compare (apart from the fact it may cost twice as much).</p>
<p>The README mentions performance issues.  I imagine that most of the execution time is spent in the Stan code, so R vs. Python is not a performance issue.</p>
<p>Any reader with expertise tuning Stan models for performance might like to check out the code.  I&#8217;m sure the Imperial folk would be happy to hear about worthwhile speed-ups.</p>

For a project that I&rsquo;m working on, I have a custom flake id spec that allows me to generate unique, sortable identifiers across computers without any sort of synchronization. The ids themselves can be encoded down to 16 bytes and I wanted to store them in Postgres. A good way to do that is to leverage Postgres&rsquo; UUID data type, which lets you efficiently store any 16 byte quantity in a way that can be indexed reasonably well.</div>

<p>If you're like me, you don't want to depend on your phone to log into a website, and you wish <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org">your favorite password manager</a> would support 2FA. Well, it can.</p>

<p>When asked to setup 2FA on a website, get a text code. If the website doesn't give you that option, just use <a href="http://zbar.sourceforge.net">zbar</a>. For instance, with the QR code from the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication">GitHub documentation</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ zbarimg totp-click-enter-code.png
QR-Code:otpauth://totp/GitHub:LyaLya?secret=qmli3dwqm53vl7fy&amp;issuer=GitHub
scanned 1 barcode symbols from 1 images in 0.03 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>Once you get the secret, put the command line to generate a code using <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/oathtool.1.html">oathtool</a> in <code>2fa/github</code> in <code>pass</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>oathtool --totp --base32 qmli3dwqm53vl7fy
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, add this to your <code>.bashrc</code> (or the equivalent for whatever shell you use):</p>

<pre><code>2fa () { eval $(pass 2fa/$1) ; }
</code></pre>

<p>You can now get your 2FA codes like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ 2fa github
795864
</code></pre>

<p>All the tools used in that article are <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/pass/">available</a> <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/oath-toolkit/">as</a> <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/zbar/">packages</a> in the Arch Linux repositories.</p>

<h2 id="complements">Complements</h2>

<p>It was <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/abmkdz/2fa_2_factor_authentication_terminal_app">a post on Lobsters</a> that prompted me to post this. <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/abmkdz/2fa_2_factor_authentication_terminal_app#c_c0y9io">Someone from the comments</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gawenr/status/1245973593453932544">a former colleague on Twitter</a> told me about <a href="https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp">a pass extension</a> I didn't know about which does almost the same thing.</p>

<p>Also, some people think that putting 2FA codes in a password manager defeats the purpose. But in practice TOTP 2FA does not really add much more to the security of my accounts than the strong random passwords I generate with pass. The "second factor" part isn't really the true benefit.</p>

<p>One actual advantage is that nobody on the network can sniff all of my credentials (like digest-based password verification methods). Another, and I think this is the main one, is that the owner of the website has chosen part of the credentials and hence ensured some degree of strength. What I do preserves both of those properties, so I'm fine with it. By the way, note that password managers like 1Password <a href="https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/">do the same thing</a>.</p>

The one thing I could do to really improve the security of the whole thing is use 2FA <em>to access pass</em> by storing my GPG key in a Yubikey. I probably will, someday.

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>It struck me while taking a break from a heavy refactoring session and browsing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cellular_automata/">/r/cellular_automata</a> that Wolfram-style cellular automata are really just glorified string substitutions. Suddenly I felt a tickling deep in my hindbrain. An idea was forming. <em>Can you implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton#Classification">a Wolfram-style cellular automata</a>, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30">Rule-30</a>, entirely within Vim using only “normal” features like macros and substitutions?</em></p>

<p>In an effort to rid myself of the crushing weight of that question (and because it was Friday), I descended into the depths and came back with an answer. <em>Yes, you can.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-is-rule-30">What is Rule 30?</h2>

<p>Before we stick our hands into a big pile of Vim, let’s take a look at what we’re trying to accomplish. Wolfram-style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automata</a> are a family of one-dimensional cellular automata where a cell’s state in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its immediate neighbors.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30">Rule 30</a>, a specific type of Wolfram-style cellular automata, derives it’s rules from the binary representation of the number thirty, <code class="language-*">00011110</code>:</p>

<table align="center">
<tbody><tr>
<th><code class="language-*">■</code><code class="language-*">■</code><code class="language-*">■</code></th>
<th><code class="language-*">■</code><code class="language-*">■</code><code class="language-*">□</code></th>
<th><code class="language-*">■</code><code class="language-*">□</code><code class="language-*">■</code></th>

<td><code class="language-*">□</code>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>As you can hopefully infer from the diagram above, an “on” cell with two “on” neighbors will turn off in the next generation. Similarly, an “off” cell with an “on” leftmost neighbor will turn on, and so on.</p>

<p>When computing the next generation, every cell with two neighbors is considered before any modifications are made. Let’s solidify our understanding by considering how the next generation of a longer initial sequence would be computed:</p>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">□□■□□
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at each cell and its imediate neighbors, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30#Rule_set">the rules</a> described above to come up with the next generation of our sequence. The first three cells are <code class="language-*">□□■</code>, which map to <code class="language-*">■</code> in the next generation. The next three cells, <code class="language-*">□■□</code>, map to <code class="language-*">■</code>. And finally, the last three cells, <code class="language-*">■□□</code>, map to <code class="language-*">■</code>.</p>

<p>This means the next generation of our initial sequence of cells (<code class="language-*">□□■□□</code>) is <code class="language-*">■■■</code>. Notice that the next generation of our automata is two cells shorter than the previous generation. A simple way of avoiding this problem is to prepend and append “off” cells to the initial generation before computing the subsequent generation. If we had done that, we’d have ended up with <code class="language-*">□■■■□</code> as our next generation, rather than <code class="language-*">■■■</code>.</p>

<p>We can repeatedly apply this operation on successive generations to create many interesting patterns, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton#Classification">balancing on the edge of chaos and order</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-seeds-of-a-plan">The Seeds of a Plan</h2>

<p>Coming into this project, I had a high-level plan of attack for accomplishing what I was after. I knew I wouldn’t be able to process every iteration of the cellular automata in one pass. I’d have to break the process down into pieces.</p>

<p>My main strategy was to break each generation, represented as a line of on/off characters, into a paragraph of three-character lines, one for each grouping of neighbors. From there I could encode the cellular automata’s rules into substitution commands, and roll the resulting paragraph of one-character lines back up into a single line.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Ranges">current-line</a> substitution was the foundation of my solution:</p>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">:.s/^\(..*\)\(\(..\).\)$/\1\3\r\2/
</code></pre>

<p>The idea behind this <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace">substitution</a> is to use <a href="http://vimregex.com/#backreferences">capture groups</a> to replace a line with everything up until the last character of the line (<code class="language-*">\1\3</code>), followed by a newline (<code class="language-*">\r</code>), and the last three characters of the original line (<code class="language-*">\2</code>). As an aside, I learned that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71323/how-to-replace-a-character-by-a-newline-in-vim">you should use <code class="language-*">\r</code> instead of <code class="language-*">\n</code> when using newlines in substitutions</a>.</p>

<p>Executed on a line with the text, <code class="language-*">□□■□□</code>, we’d get the following result:</p>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">□□□■□□
□□□
</code></pre>

<p>Repeatedly applying this substitution would give us the following paragraph of lines:</p>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">□□□
□□■
□■□
■□□
□□□
</code></pre>

<p>From here, we can translate our eight Rule 30 rules into global substitutions:</p>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">:%s/^■■■$/□/g
:%s/^■■□$/□/g
:%s/^■□■$/□/g
:%s/^■□□$/■/g
:%s/^□■■$/■/g
:%s/^□■□$/■/g
:%s/^□□■$/■/g
:%s/^□□□$/□/g
</code></pre>

<p>Running those substitutions on our paragraph gives us a new paragraph made up of single character lines. Each of these characters is a cell in our next generation:</p>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">□
■
■
■
□
</code></pre>

<p>Next we just need to roll that paragraph back up into a single line. <code class="language-*">J</code> is the tool for joining lines in Vim, but <code class="language-*">J</code> insists on separating newly concatenated lines with a space. It turns out <a href="https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/439/how-to-join-lines-without-producing-a-space">you can join lines directly with the <code class="language-*">gJ</code> command</a>:</p>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">□■■■□
</code></pre>

<p>And just like that we have our next generation.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-our-plan">Implementing Our Plan</h2>

<p>The outline of our plan includes lots of hand waving, like “repeatedly applying this substitution,” which just won’t cut it for a fully automated cellular automata generation machine.</p>

<p>We need a way of turning our very hands-on algorithm into a hands-off, fully automated solution. An elegant way of doing this is using <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Macros">Vim’s built-in macro system</a>. Vim macros are ridiculously powerful while being ridiculously simple in concept. <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/vim-macro-trickz/">They’re just stored keystrokes</a>. This means there’s nothing stopping a macro (stored in, say, the <code class="language-*">q</code> register) from invoking itself recursively (<code class="language-*">@q</code>). This opens the door for quite a few interesting possibilities.</p>

<p>In the hope of building a fully automated solution, let’s implement our cellular automata generator as a script of keystrokes that can be executed in <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/starting.html#-s">“batch mode”</a> with the <code class="language-*">-s</code> flag. Once finished, we’ll be able to invoke our generator on a file containing a seed, or an initial sequence of cells, with the following command:</p>

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">vim -s script seed
</code></pre>

<p>We’ll start off our script by using <code class="language-*">setreg</code> (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_use/-pbK15zfqts">instead of <code class="language-*">let</code></a>) to define a macro <code class="language-*">b</code> that will perform our first set of substitutions and build our paragraph of three-character lines:</p>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">:call setreg('b', ':.s/^\(..*\)\(\(..\).\)$/\1\3\r\2/|norm!``@b', 'l')
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-*">|norm!``</code> at the end of our substitution <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10468324/vim-replace-all-without-cursor-moving">returns the cursor to it’s starting place</a> after each replacement.</p>

<p>Next, let’s define a macro to perform each of our Rule 30 replacements. I built these as eight separate macros, rather than one macro that performed eight substitutions because any of these substitutions might not find what they’re looking for, which causes it’s active macro execution to fail. Breaking each substitution out into it’s own macro prevents its potential failure from affecting other rules:</p>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">:call setreg('1', ':%s/^■■■$/□/g', 'l')
:call setreg('2', ':%s/^■■□$/□/g', 'l')
:call setreg('3', ':%s/^■□■$/□/g', 'l')
:call setreg('4', ':%s/^■□□$/■/g', 'l')
:call setreg('5', ':%s/^□■■$/■/g', 'l')
:call setreg('6', ':%s/^□■□$/■/g', 'l')
:call setreg('7', ':%s/^□□■$/■/g', 'l')
:call setreg('8', ':%s/^□□□$/□/g', 'l')
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s write one more macro, <code class="language-*">c</code>, to roll our paragraph of Rule 30 replacements back up into a single line:</p>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">:call setreg('c', '''aV}gJ', 'l')
</code></pre>

<p>Now we’ll tie everything together with a macro, <code class="language-*">a</code>, that copies the current line and pastes it below, performs our recursive line destructing, carries out our Rule 30 replacements, and then rolls everything back together, producing the next generation of our cells right below the previous generation:</p>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">:call setreg('a', 'yypma:.s/^.*$/ \0 /|norm!``@b@1@2@3@4@5@6@7@8@c', 'l')
</code></pre>

<p>We can produce the next two generations of a given starting generation by calling <code class="language-*">a</code> two times:</p>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">:norm 2@a
</code></pre>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">□□■□□
□■■■□
■■□□■
</code></pre>

<p>If we start with a bigger starting generation (fifty “off” cells on either side of a single “on” cell, in this case), we could go even further!</p>

<div>
  <img src="http://www.petecorey.com/img/2020-04-03-wolfram-style-cellular-automata-with-vim-macros/rule30.png" />
  <p>Fifty generations of Rule 30 generated entirely within Vim.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>And with that, we can finally answer the question that has plagued us for so long. <em>You can implement a Wolfram-style cellular automata, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30">Rule-30</a>, entirely within Vim using only “normal” features like macros and substitutions.</em> Rest easy, my tired brain.</p>

<p>Altogether our <code class="language-*">script</code> looks like this, and produces fifty generations of a given seed:</p>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">:call setreg('a', 'yypma:.s/^.*$/□\0□/|norm!``@b@1@2@3@4@5@6@7@8@c', 'l')
:call setreg('b', ':.s/^\(..*\)\(\(..\).\)$/\1\3\r\2/|norm!``@b', 'l')
:call setreg('1', ':%s/^■■■$/□/g', 'l')
:call setreg('2', ':%s/^■■□$/□/g', 'l')
:call setreg('3', ':%s/^■□■$/□/g', 'l')
:call setreg('4', ':%s/^■□□$/■/g', 'l')
:call setreg('5', ':%s/^□■■$/■/g', 'l')
:call setreg('6', ':%s/^□■□$/■/g', 'l')
:call setreg('7', ':%s/^□□■$/■/g', 'l')
:call setreg('8', ':%s/^□□□$/□/g', 'l')
:call setreg('c', '''aV}gJ', 'l')
:norm 50@a
</code></pre>

<p>I’m no Vim expert by any stretch of the imagination, so if you think you can improve on this solution, either in terms of terseness or clarity, while staying in the bounds of only using normal Vim features (no Vimscript), <a href="https://twitter.com/petecorey">please let me know</a>!</p>

<p>As a closing remark, I want to be clear and say that this project served absolutely no purpose, and this is a terribly inefficient way of propagating cellular automata. That said, learned quite a lot about my text editor of choice, which I consider to be invaluable.</p></div>

<span class="date">April 01, 2020 12:00 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
I'm recruiting a funded Masters student to study how AI bots play games. The goal is to systematically understand the kinds of difficulty posed by games to AI algorithms, as well as the robustness of any conclusions. Some example experiments include: looking at how performance scales with parameters such as CPU time and problem size; how sensitive results are to rule variations, choice of algorithm parameters, etc.; and identification of games that maximally differentiate algorithm performance. Two previous papers of mine that give some flavor of this kind of research: <a href="http://www.kmjn.org/publications/MCTSScaling_CIG16-abstract.html">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.kmjn.org/publications/GVGprofiles_Evostar15-abstract.html">[2]</a>.

<p>
The primary desired skill is ability to run computational simulations, and to collect and analyze data from them. The available funding would pay for four semesters of full-ride Masters tuition, plus 15-20 hours/week of a work-study job during the academic year. The <a href="https://www.american.edu/gamelab/">American University Game Lab</a> offers three Masters-level degrees: the <a href="https://www.american.edu/cas/cs/ms/">MS in Computer Science's</a> Game &amp; Computational Media track, the <a href="https://www.american.edu/gamelab/ma/">MA in Game Design</a>, and the <a href="https://www.american.edu/gamelab/mfa/">MFA in Games and Interactive Media</a>.

<p>
The successful applicant would be funded on the National Science Foundation grant <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1948017">Characterizing Algorithm-Relative Difficulty of Agent Benchmarks</a>. This does not have any citizenship/nationality requirements.

<p>
Anyone interested should both apply for the desired Masters program through the official application linked above (deadline July 1, though earlier is better), and email me to indicate that they would like to be considered for this scholarship. It's also fine to email me with inquiries before applying.</p></p></p></div>

<span class="date">April 01, 2020 12:00 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p><em><strong>Errata:</strong> An earlier version of this post was misrepresenting conditions as exceptions, which has been addressed.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I have been reading <em><a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a></em> by Peter Seibel over the weekend, which is an excellent introduction to Common Lisp, showcasing its power by writing real programs. If you are interested in Lisp or programming languages at all, I recommend at least skimming it, it is free to read online.</p>
<p>Writing a Lisp-descended language professionally, and also living inside Emacs, I had dabbled in Common Lisp before, but I still found something I was not aware of, restarts. I do not think that this is a particularly well known feature outside the Lisp world, so I would like to spread awareness, as I think it is a particularly interesting take on error handling.</p>
<p>The book explains restarts using a mocked parser, which I will slightly modify for my example. Imagine you are writing an interpreter/compiler for a language. On the lowest level you are parsing lines to some internal representation:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp">(<span class="kw">define-condition</span><span class="fu"> invalid-line-error </span>(<span class="kw">error</span>)
  ((line :initarg :line :reader line)))

(<span class="kw">defun</span><span class="fu"> parse-line </span>(line)
  (<span class="kw">if</span> (valid-line-p line)
      (to-ir line)
    (<span class="kw">error</span> 'invalid-line-error :line line)))</code></pre></div>
<p>We define a condition, which is similar to an exception object with metadata in other languages<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">A “condition” in Common Lisp, as has been explained to me by <a href="https://phoe.github.io">Michał “phoe” Herda</a>, is a way of signalling arbitrary events up the stack to allow running of additional code, not just signalling errors. They’re comparable to hooks in Emacs, but dynamically scoped to the current call stack.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, and a function which attempts to parse a single line.<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This is assuming of course that a line always represents a complete parsable entity, but this is only an example after all.<br />
<br />
</span></span> If it turns out that the line is invalid, it signals a condition up the stack. We attach the line encountered, in case we want to use it for error reporting.</p>
<p>Now imagine your parser is used in two situations: there is a compiler, and a REPL. For the compiler, you would like to abort at the first invalid line you encounter, which is what we are currently set up to do. But for the REPL, you would like to ignore the line and just continue with the next line.<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I’m not saying that is necessarily a good idea, but it is something some REPLs do, for example some Clojure REPLs.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>To ignore a line, we would have to either do it on a low-level, return <code>nil</code> instead of signalling and filter out <code>nil</code> values up the stack. Handling the condition will not help us a lot, because at that point we have lost our position in the file already, or have we?</p>
<p>The next layer up is parsing a collection of lines:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp">(<span class="kw">defun</span><span class="fu"> parse-lines </span>(lines)
  (<span class="kw">loop</span> for line in lines
        for entry <span class="op">=</span> (<span class="kw">restart-case</span>
                     (parse-line line)
                     (skip-line () <span class="kw">nil</span>))
        <span class="kw">when</span> entry collect it))</code></pre></div>
<p>This is where the magic begins. The <code>loop</code> construct just loops over the lines, applies <code>parse-line</code> to every element of the list, and returns a list containing all results which are not <code>nil</code>. The feature I am showcasing in this post is <code>restart-case</code>. Think of it this way: it does <strong>not</strong> handle a condition, but when the stack starts unwinding <span><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Technically not unwinding yet, at least not in Common Lisp.<br />
<br />
</span></span> because we signalled a condition in <code>parse-line</code>, it registers a possible restart-position. If the condition is handled at some point,<span><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">If it isn’t caught, you will get dropped into the debugger, which also gives you the option to restart.<br />
<br />
</span></span> the signal handler can choose to restart at any restart-point that has been registered down the stack.</p>
<p>Now let us have a look at the callers:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp">(<span class="kw">defun</span><span class="fu"> parse-compile </span>(lines)
  (<span class="kw">handler-case</span>
      (parse-lines lines)
    (invalid-line-error (e)
                        (print-error e))))

(<span class="kw">defun</span><span class="fu"> parse-repl </span>(lines)
  (<span class="kw">handler-bind</span> ((invalid-line-error
                  #'(<span class="kw">lambda</span> (e)
                      (<span class="kw">invoke-restart</span> 'skip-line))))
    (parse-lines lines)))</code></pre></div>
<p>There is a lot to unpack here. The compiler code is using <code>handler-case</code>, which is comparable to <code>catch</code> in other languages. It unwinds the stack to the current point and runs the signal handling code, in this case <code>print-error</code>.</p>
<p>Because we do not actually want to unwind the stack all the way, but resume execution inside the <code>loop</code> in <code>parse-lines</code>, we use a different construct, <code>handler-bind</code>, which automatically handles <code>invalid-line-error</code> and invokes the <code>skip-line</code> restart. If you scroll up to <code>parse-lines</code> now, you will see that the restart clause says, if we restart here, just return <code>nil</code>, and <code>nil</code> will be filtered on the very next line by <code>when entry</code>.</p>
<p>The elegance here is the split of signal handling code, and decisions about which signal handling approach to take. You can register a lot of different <code>restart-case</code> statements throughout the stack, and let the caller decide if some signals are okay to ignore, without the caller having to have intricate knowledge of the lower-level code.<span><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">It does need to know about the registered <code>restart-case</code> statements though, at least by name.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>If you want to learn more about this, make sure to have a look at the book, it goes into much more detail than I did here.</p></div>

<span class="date">March 29, 2020 10:38 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Which programming languages have been the most influential?  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s define an influential language as one that has had an impact on lots of developers.  What impact might a programming language have on developers?</p>
<p>To have an impact a language needs to be used by lots of people, or at least have a big impact on a language that is used by lots of people.</p>
<p>Figuring out the possible impacts a language might have had is very difficult, requiring knowledge of different application domains, software history, and implementation techniques.  The following discussion of specific languages illustrate some of the issues.</p>
<p><a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2014/12/19/snobol-4-simula-67-smalltalk-sed-sql-setl-scratch-and-spreadsheet/">Simula</a> is an example of a language used by a handful of people, but a few of the people under its influence went on to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a> and C++.  Some people reacted against the complexity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_68">Algol 68</a>, creating much simpler languages (e.g., Pascal), while others thought some of its feature were neat and reused them (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell">Bourne shell</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2012/02/12/o-cobol-cobol-wherefore-art-thou-cobol/">Cobol</a> has been very influential, at least within business computing (those who have not worked in business computing complain about constructs handling uses that it was not really designed to handle, rather than appreciating its strengths in doing what it was designed to do, e.g., reading/writing and converting a wide range of different numeric data formats).  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RPG">RPG</a> may have been even more influential in this usage domain (all businesses have to specific requirements on formatting reports).</p>
<p>I suspect that most people could not point to the major influence C has had on almost every language since.  No, not the use of <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>; if a single character is going to be used as a compound statement bracketing token, this pair are the only available choice.  Almost every language now essentially uses C&#8217;s operator precedence (rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a>&#8216;s, which is slightly different; R follows Fortran).</p>
<p><a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2014/12/01/algol-60-awk-algol-68-ada-apl-and-assembler/">Algol 60</a> has been very influential: until C came along it was the base template for many languages.</p>
<p>Fortran is still widely used in scientific and engineering software.  Its impact on other languages may be unknown to those involved.  The intricacies of floating-point arithmetic are difficult to get right, and <a href="https://wg5-fortran.org/">WG5</a> (the ISO language committee, although the original work was done by the ANSI committee, <a href="http://www.incits.org/committees/pl22.3">J3</a>).  Fortran code is often computationally intensive, and many optimization techniques started out optimizing Fortran (see &#8220;Optimizing Compilers for Modern Architectures&#8221; by Allen and Kennedy). </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> showed how it was possible to create a usable interactive language system.  The compactness of its many, and varied, implementations were successful because they did not take up much storage and were immediately usable.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a> has been influential in the embedded systems domain, and also people fall in love with  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_code">threaded code</a> as an implementation technique (see &#8220;Threaded Interpretive Languages&#8221; by Loeliger).</p>
<p>During the mid-1990s the growth of the Internet enabled a few new languages to become widely used, e.g., PHP and Javascript.  It&#8217;s difficult to say whether these were more influenced by what their creators ate the night before or earlier languages.  PHP and Javascript are widely used, and they have influenced the creation of many languages designed to fix their myriad of issues.</p></div>

<h2 id="what-is-a-distribution">What is a distribution</h2>

<p>What are software distributions? You may think you know everything there
is to know about the term software distribution, but take a moment to
think about it, take a step back and try to see the big picture.</p>

<p>We often have in mind the thousands of Linux distributions when we hear
it, however, this is far from limited to Linux, BSD, Berkeley Software
Distribution, has software distribution right in the name. Android,
and iOS are software distributions too.</p>

<p>Actually, it’s so prevalent, we may have stopped paying attention to
the concept. We find it hard to put a definition together.<br />
There’s definitely the part about distributing software in it. Software
that may be commercial or not, open source or not.<br />
To understand it better maybe investigating what problems software
distributions address would clear things up.</p>

<p>Let’s imagine a world before software distributions, does that world
exist? A world where software stays within boundaries, not shared with anyone
outside of it.<br />
Once we break these boundaries and we want to share it, we’ll find that we
have to package all the software together in a meaningful way, configure
them so that they work well together, adding some glue in between when
necessary, find the appropriate medium to distribute the bundle, get
it all from one end to another safely, make sure it installs properly,
and follow up on it.</p>

<p>Thus, software distribution is about the mechanism and the community
that takes the burden and decisions to build an assemblage of coherent
software that can be shipped.</p>

<p>The operating system, or kernel if you like, could be, and is often,
part of the collage offered, a software just like others.</p>

<p>The people behind it are called distribution maintainers, or package
maintainers. Their role vary widely, they could write the software that
stores all the packages called the repository, maintain a package manager
with its format, maintain a full operating system installer, package and
upload software they built or that someone else built on a specific time
frame/life cycle, make sure there aren’t any malicious code uploaded on
the repository, follow up on the latest security issues and bug reports,
fix third party software to fit the distribution philosophical choices
and configurations, and most importantly test, plan, and make sure
everything holds up together.<br />
These maintainers are the source of trust of the distribution, they
take responsibility for it. In fact, I think it’s more accurate to call
them distributors.</p>

<h2 id="different-ways-to-approach-it">Different ways to approach it</h2>

<p>There’s so many distributions it can make your head spin. The software
world is booming, especially the open source one. For instance, we can
find bifurcations of distributions that get copied by new maintainers
and divert. This creates a tree like aspect, a genealogy of both common
ancestors and/or influences in technical and philosophical choices.<br />
Overall, we now have a vibrant ecosystem where a thing learned on a
branch can help a completely unrelated leaf on another tree. There’s
something for everyone.</p>

<h3 id="target-and-speciality">Target and speciality</h3>

<p>So what could be so different between all those software distributions,
why not have a single platform that everyone can build on.</p>

<p>One thing is specialization and differentiation. Each distro caters to
a different audience and is built by a community with its philosophy.</p>

<p>Let’s go over some of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A distribution can support specific sets and combinations of hardware:
from CPU ISA to peripherals drivers</li>
  <li>A distribution may be specifically optimized for a type of environment:
Be it desktop, portable mobile device, servers, warehouse size computers,
embedded devices, virtualised environment, etc..</li>
  <li>A distribution can be commercially backed or not</li>
  <li>A distribution can be designed for different levels of knowledge in a
domain, professional or not. For instance, security research, scientific
computing, music production, multimedia box, HUD in cars, mobile device
interface, etc..</li>
  <li>A distribution might have been certified to follow certain standards
that need to be adhere to in professional settings, for example security
standards and hardening</li>
  <li>A distribution may have a single purpose in a commodity machine,
specific machine functionalities such as firewall, a computer cluster,
a router, etc..</li>
</ul>

<p>That all comes to the raison d’être, the philosophy of the distribution,
it guides every decision the maintainers have to make. It guides how they
configure every software, how they think about security, portability,
comprehensiveness.</p>

<p>For example, if a distribution cares about free software, it’s going to
be strict about what software it includes and what licenses it allows
in its repository, having software to check the consistency of licenses
in the core.<br />
Another example is if their goal is to target a desktop audience then
internationalization, ease of use, user friendliness, having a large
number of packages, is going to be prioritized. While, again, if the
target is a real time embedded device, the size of the kernel is going
to be small, configured and optimized for this purpose, and limiting and
choosing the appropriate packages that work in this environment. Or if
it’s targeted at advanced users that love having control of their machine,
the maintainers will choose to let the users make most of the decisions,
providing as many packages as possible with the latest version possible,
with a loosely way to install the distribution, having a lot of libraries
and software development tools.</p>

<p>What this means is that a distribution does anything it can to provide
sane defaults that fit its mindset. It composes and configures a layer
of components, a stack of software.</p>

<h3 id="the-layering">The layering</h3>

<p>Distribution maintainers often have at their disposition different blocks
and the ability to choose them, stacking them to create a unit we call a
software distribution. There’s a range of approaches to this, they could
choose to have more, or less, included in what they consider the <em>core</em> of
the distribution and what is externally less important to it.<br />
Moreover, sometimes they might even leave the core very small and loose,
instead providing the glue software that makes it easy for the users
to choose and swap the blocks at specific stages in time: installation,
run time, maintenance mode, etc..</p>

<p>So what are those blocks of interdependent components.</p>

<p>The first part is the method of installation, this is what everything
hinges on, the starting point.</p>

<p>The second part is the kernel, the real core of all operating systems
today. But that doesn’t mean that the distribution has to enforce
it. Some distributions may go as far as to provide multiple kernels
specialised in different things or none at all.</p>

<p>The third part is the filesystem and file hierarchy, the component that
manages where and how files are spread out on the physical or virtual
hardware. This could be a mix and match where sections of the file system
tree are stored on separate filesystems.</p>

<p>The fourth part is the init system, PID 1. This choice has generated
a lot of contention these days. PID 1 being the mother process of all
other processes on the system. What role it has and what functionalities
it should include is a subject of debate.</p>

<p>The fifth part is composed of the shell utilities, what we sometimes
refer to as the userland or user space, as its the first layer the user
can directly interface with to have control of the operating system, the
place where processes run. The userland implementations on Unix-based
systems usually tries to follow the POSIX standard. There are many such
implementations, also subject of contention.</p>

<p>The sixth part is made up of services and their management. The daemons,
long running processes that keep the system in order. Many argue if the
management functionality should be part of the init system or not.</p>

<p>The seventh part is documentation. Often it is forgotten but it is still
very important.</p>

<p>The last part is about everything else, all the user interfaces and
utilities a user can have and ways to manage them on the system.</p>

<h3 id="stable-releases-vs-rolling">Stable releases vs Rolling</h3>

<p>There exists a spectrum on which distributions place themselves when
it comes to keeping up to date with the versions of the software they
provide. This most often applies to external third party open source
software.<br />
The spectrum is the following: Do we allow the users to always have the
latest version of every software while running the risk of accidentally
breaking their system, what we call bleeding edge or rolling distro, or
do we take a more conservative approach and take the time to test every
software properly before allowing it in the repository, while not having
all the latest updates, features, and optimizations of those software,
what we call release based distro.</p>

<p>The extreme of the first scenario would be to let users directly download
from the software vendor/creator source code repository, or the opposite,
let the software vendor/creator push directly to the distribution
repository. Which could easily break or conflict with the user’s system
or lead to security vulnerability. We’ll come back to this later, as
this could be avoided if the software runs in a containerized environment.</p>

<p>When it comes to release distributions, it usually involves having a long
term support stable version that keeps receiving and syncing with the
necessary security updates and bug fixes on the long run while having
another version running a bit ahead testing the future changes. On
specific time frames, users can jump to the latest release of the
distribution, which may involve a lot of changes in both configuration
and software.<br />
Some distributions decide they may want to break ABI or API of the kernel
upon major releases, that means that everything in the system needs to
be rebuilt and reinstalled.</p>

<p>The release cycle, and the rate of updates is really a spectrum.</p>

<p>When it comes to updates, in both cases, the distribution maintainers
have to decide how to communicate and handle them. How to let the users
know what changes. If a user configuration was swapped for a new one or
merged with the new one, or copied aside.<br />
Communication is essential, be it through official channels, logging,
mails, etc.. Communication needs to be bi-directional, users report bugs
and maintainers posts what their decisions are and if users need to be
involved in them. This creates the community around the distribution.</p>

<p>Rolling releases require intensive efforts from package maintainers as
they constantly have to keep up with software developers. Especially
when it comes to the thousands of newest libraries that are part of
recent programming languages and that keep on increasing.</p>

<p>Various users will want precise things out of a system. Enterprise
environments and mission critical tasks will prefer stable releases,
and software developers or normal end users may prefer to have the
ability to use the latest current software.</p>

<h3 id="interdistribution-standard">Interdistribution standard</h3>

<p>With all this, can’t there be an interdistribution standard that creates
order, and would we want such standard.</p>

<p>At the user level, the differences are not always noticeable, most
of the time everything seems to work as Unix systems are expected to
work.<br />
There’s no real standard between distributions other than that they are
more or less following the POSIX standards.</p>

<p>Within the Linux ecosystem, the Free Standards Group tries to improve
interoperability of software by fixing a common Linux ABI, file system
hierarchy, naming conventions, and more. But that’s just the tip of the
iceberg when it comes to having something that works interdistributions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, each part of the layering we’ve seen before could be said
to have its own standards: There are desktop interoperability standards,
filesystem standards, networking standards, security standards, etc..</p>

<p>The biggest player right now when it comes to this is systemd in
association with the free desktop group, it tries to create (force)
an interdistribution standard for Linux distribution.</p>

<p>But again, the big Question: Do we actually want such inter-distribution
standards, can’t we be happy with the mix and match we currently
have. Would we profit from such thing?</p>

<h2 id="the-package-manager-and-packaging">The package manager and packaging</h2>

<p>Let’s now pay attention to the package themselves, how we store them, how
we give secure access to them, how we are able to search amongst them,
download them, install them, remove them, and anything related to their
local management, versioning, and configuration.</p>

<h3 id="method-of-distribution">Method of distribution</h3>

<p>How do we distribute software, share them, what’s the front-end to
this process.</p>

<p>First of all, where do we store this software.</p>

<p>Historically and still today, software can be shared via physical
medium such as CD-ROM, DVD, USBs, etc.. This is common when it comes
to proprietary vendors to have the distribution come with a piece of
hardware they are selling, it’s also common for the procurement of the
initial installation image.<br />
However, with today’s hectic software growth, using a physical medium
isn’t flexible. Sharing over the internet is more convenient, be it via
FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, a publicly available svn or git repo, via central
website hubs such as Github or appliation stores such the ones Apple
and Google provide.</p>

<p>A requirement is that the storage and the communication to it should be
secure, reliable against failures, and accessible from anywhere. Thus,
replication is often done to avoid failures but also to have a sort of
edge network speeding effect across the world, load balancing. Replication
could be done in multiple ways, it could be a P2P distributed system
for instance.</p>

<p>How we store it and in what format is up to the repository
maintainers. Usually, this is a file system with a software API users
can interact with over the wire. Two main format strategies exist:
source based repositories and binary repositories.</p>

<p>Second of all, who can upload and manage the host of packages. Who has
the right to replicate the repository.</p>

<p>As a source of truth for the users, it is important to make sure the
packages have been verified and secured before being accepted on the
repository.</p>

<p>Many distribution have the maintainers be the only ones that are able
to do this. Giving them cryptographic keys to sign packages and validate
them.</p>

<p>Others have their own users build the packages, send them to a central
hub for automatic or manual verification and then uploaded to the
repository. Each user having their own cryptographic key for signature
verification.</p>

<p>This comes down to an issue of trust and stability. Having the users
upload packages isn’t always feasible when using binary packages if the
individual packages are not containerized properly.</p>

<p>There’s a third option, the road in between, having the two types, the
core managed by the official distribution maintainers and the rest by
its user community.</p>

<p>Finally, the packages reach the user.</p>

<p>How the user interact with the repository locally and remotely depends on
the package management choices. Do users cache a version of the remote
repository, like is common with the BSD port tree system.<br />
How flexible can it be to track updates, locking versions of software,
allowing downgrades. Can users download from different sources. Can
users have multiple version of the same software on the their machine.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>

<p>As we’ve said there are two main philosophy of software sharing format:
source code port-style and pre-built binary packages.</p>

<p>The software that manages those on the user side is called the package
manager, it’s the link with the repository. Though, in source based repo
I’m not sure we can call them this way, but regardless I’ll still refer
to them as such.<br />
Many distributions create their own or reuse a popular one. It does the
search, download, install, update, and removal of local software. It’s
not a small task.</p>

<p>The rule of the book is that if it isn’t installed by the package manager
then it won’t be aware of its existence. Noting that distributions don’t
have to be limited to a single package manager, there could be many.</p>

<p>Each package manager relies on a specific format and metadata to be able
to manage software, be it source or binary formatted. This format can
be composed of a group of files or a single binary file with specific
information segments that together create recipes that help throughout
its lifecycle. Some are easier to put together than others, incidentally
allowing more user contributions.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of common information that the package manager needs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The package name</li>
  <li>The version</li>
  <li>The description</li>
  <li>The dependencies on other packages, along with their versions</li>
  <li>The directory layout that needs to be created for the package</li>
  <li>Along with the configuration files that it needs and if they should
be overwritten or not</li>
  <li>An integrity, or ECC, on all files, such as SHA256</li>
  <li>Authenticity, to know that it comes from the trusted source, such as
cryptographic signatures checked against a trusted store on the user’s
machine</li>
  <li>If this is a group of package, meta package, or a direct one</li>
  <li>The actions to take on certain events: pre-installation,
post-installation, pre-removal, and post removal</li>
  <li>If there are specific configuration flags or parameter to pass to the
package manager upon installation</li>
</ul>

<p>So what’s the advantage of having pre-compiled binary packages instead
of cloning the source code and compiling ourselves. Won’t that remove
a burden from package maintainers.</p>

<p>One advantage is that pre-compiled packages are convenient, it’s easier to
download them and run them instantly. It’s also hard, if not impossible,
these days, and energy intensive, to compile huge software such as
web browsers.<br />
Another point, is that proprietary software are often already distributed
as binary packages, which would creates a mix of source and binary
packages.</p>

<p>Binary formats are also space efficient as the code is stored in a
compressed archived format. For example: APK, Deb, Nix, ORB, PKG, RPM,
Snap, pkg.tar.gz/xz, etc..<br />
Some package managers may also choose to leave the choice of compression
up to the user and dynamically discern from its configuration file how
to decompress packages.</p>

<p>Let’s add that there exists tools, such as “Alien”, that facilitate the
job of package maintainers by converting from one binary package format
to another.</p>

<h2 id="conflict-resolution--dependencies-management">Conflict resolution &amp; Dependencies management</h2>

<h3 id="resolving-dependencies">Resolving dependencies</h3>

<p>One of the hardest job of the package manager is to resolve dependencies.</p>

<p>A package manager has to keep a list of all the packages and their
versions that are currently installed on the system and their
dependencies.<br />
When the user wants to install a package, it has to take as input the
list of dependencies of that package, compare it against the one it
already has and output a list of what needs to be installed in an order
that satisfies all dependencies.</p>

<p>This is a problem that is commonly encountered in the software development
world with build automation utilities such as make. The tool creates a
directed acyclic graph (DAG), and using the power of graph theory and the
acyclic dependencies principle (ADP) tries to find the right order. If
no solution is found, or if there are conflicts or cycles in the graph,
the action should be aborted.</p>

<p>The same applies in reverse, upon removal of the package. We have to make
a decision, do we remove all the other packages that were installed as
a dependency of that single one. What if newer packages depend on those
dependencies, should we only allow the removal of the unused dependencies.</p>

<p>This is a hard problem, indeed.</p>

<h3 id="versioning">Versioning</h3>

<p>This problem increases when we add the factor of versioning to the mix,
if we allow multiple versions of the same software to be installed on
the system.</p>

<p>If we don’t, but allow switching from one version to another, do we also
switch all other packages that depend on it too.</p>

<p>Versioning applies everywhere, not only to packages but to release
versions of the distribution too. A lot of them attach certain version
of packages to specific releases, and consequentially releases may have
different repositories.</p>

<p>The choice of naming conventions also plays a role, it should convey to
users what they are about and if any changes happened.</p>

<p>Should the package maintainer follow the naming convention of the software
developer or should they use their own. What if the name of two software
conflict with one another, this makes it impossible to have it in the
repo, some extra information needs to be added.</p>

<p>Do we rely on semantic versioning, major, minor, patch, or do we rely
on names like so many distributions releases do (toy story, deserts,
etc..), or do we rely on the date it was released, or maybe simply an
incremental number.</p>

<p>All those convey meaning to the user when they search and update packages
from the repository.</p>

<h3 id="static-vs-dynamic-linking">Static vs dynamic linking</h3>

<p>One thing that may not apply to source based distro, is the decision
between building packages as statically linked to libraries or dynamically
linked.</p>

<p>Dynamic linking is the process in which a program chooses not to include
a library it depends upon in its executable but only a reference to it,
which is then resolved at run-time by a dynamic linker that will load
the shared object in memory upon usage. On the opposite, static linking
means storing the libraries right inside the compiled executable program.</p>

<p>Dynamic linking is useful when many software rely on the same library,
thus only a single instance of the library has to be in memory at a time.
Executables sizes are also smaller, and when it is updated all programs
relying on it get the benefit (as long as the interfaces are the same).</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with distributions and package management.</p>

<p>Package managers in dynamic linking environment have to take care of
the versions of the libraries that are installed and which packages
depend on them. This can create issues if different packages rely on
different versions.</p>

<p>For this reason, some distro communities have chosen to get rid of dynamic
linking altogether and rely on static linking, at least for things that
are not related to the core system.</p>

<p>Another incidental advantage of static linking is that it doesn’t have
to resolve dependencies with the dynamic linker, which makes it gain a
small boost in speed.</p>

<p>So static builds simplify the package management process. There
doesn’t need to be a complex DAG because everything is self
contained. Additionally, this can allow to have multiple versions of the
same software installed alongside one another without conflicts. Updates
and rollbacks are not messy with static linking.</p>

<p>This gives rise to more containerised software, and continuing on this
path leads to market platforms such as Android and iOS where distribution
can be done by the individual software developers themselves, skipping the
middle-man altogether and giving the ability for increasingly impatient
users to always have the latest version that works for their current
OS. Everything is self-packaged.<br />
However, this relies heavily on the trust of the
repository/marketplace. There needs to be many security mechanisms in
place to not allow rogue software to be uploaded. We’ll talk more about
this when we come back to containers</p>

<p>This is great for users and, from a certain perspective, software
developers too as they can directly distribute pre-built packages,
especially when there’s a stable ABI for the base system.</p>

<p>All this breaks the classic distribution scheme we’re accustomed to on
the desktop.</p>

<p>Is it all roses and butterflies, though.</p>

<p>As we’ve said, packages take much more space with static linking, thus
wasting resources (storage, memory, power).<br />
Moreover, because it’s a model where software developers push directly
to users, this removes the filtering that distribution maintainers have
over the distro, and encourages licenses uncertainties. There’s no more
overall philosophies that surrounds the distribution.<br />
There’s also the issue of library updates, the weight is on the software
developers to make sure they have no vulnerabilities or bugs in their
code. This adds a veil on which software uses what, all we see is the
end products.</p>

<p>From a software developer using this type of distribution perspective,
this adds extra steps to download the source code of each libraries their
software depends on, and build each one individually. Turning the system
into a source based distro.</p>

<h3 id="reproducibility">Reproducibility</h3>

<p>Because package management is increasingly becoming messier the past few
years, a new trend has emerged to put back a sense of order in all this,
reproducibility.</p>

<p>It has been inspired by the world of functional programming and the world
of containers. Package managers that respect reproducibility have each
of their builds asserted to always produce the same output (functionality wise, though there could be differences, see footnote for info).<br />
They allow for packages of different versions to be installed alongside
one another, each living in its own tree, and it allows normal users
to install packages only them can access. Thus, many users can have
different packages.</p>

<p>They can be used as universal package managers, installed alongside any
other package managers without conflict.</p>

<p>The most prominent example is Nix and Guix, that use a purely functional
deployment model where software is installed into unique directories
generated through cryptographic hashes. Dependencies from each software
are included within each hash, solving the problem of dependency
hell. This approach to package management promises to generate more
reliable, reproducible, and portable packages.</p>

<h3 id="stateless-and-verifiable-systems">Stateless and verifiable systems</h3>

<p>The discussion about trust, portability, and reproducibility can also
be applied to the whole system itself.</p>

<p>When we talked about repositories as marketplaces, where software
developers push directly to it and the users have instant access to the
latest version, we said it was mandatory to have additional measures
for security.</p>

<p>One of them is to containerised, to sandbox every software. Having each
software run in their own space not affecting the rest of the system
resources. This removes the heavy burden of auditing and verifying each
and every software. Many solutions exist to achieve this sandboxing, from
docker, chroot, jails, firejail, selinux, cgroups, etc..</p>

<p>We could also distance the home directory of the users, making them
self-contained, never installing or modifying the globally accessible
places.</p>

<p>This could let us have the core of the system verifiable as it is not
changed, as it stays pristine. Making sure it’s secure would be really
easy.</p>

<p>The idea of having the user part of the distro as atomic, movable,
containerized, and the rest reproducible is game changing. But again,
do we want to move to a world where every distro is interchangeable?</p>

<h2 id="do-distros-matter-with-containers-virtualisation-and-specific-and-universal-package-managers">Do Distros matter with containers, virtualisation, and specific and universal package managers</h2>

<p>It remains to be asked if distributions still have a role today with
all the containers, virtualisation, and specific and universal package
managers.</p>

<p>When it comes to containers, they are still very important as they most
often are the base of the stack the other components build upon.</p>

<p>The distribution is made up of people that work together to build and
distribute the software and make sure it works fine. It isn’t the role
of the person managing the container and much more convenient for them
to rely on a distribution.</p>

<p>Another point, is that containers hide vulnerabilities, they aren’t
checked after they are put together, while on the other hand, distribution
maintainers, have as a role to communicate and follow up on security
vulnerabilities and other bugs. Community is what solves daunting problems
that everyone shares.<br />
A system administrator building containers can’t possibly have the
knowledge to manage and builds hundreds of software and libraries and
ensure they work well together.</p>

<h3 id="if-packages-are-self-contained">If packages are self-contained</h3>

<p>Do distributions matter if packages are self-contained?</p>

<p>To an extent they do as they could be in this ecosystem the
providers/distributors of such universal self-contained packages. And
as we’ve said it is important to keep the philosophy of the distro and
offer a tested toolbox that fits the use case.</p>

<p>What’s more probable is that we’ll move to a world with multiple package
managers, each trusted for its specific space and purpose. Each with a
different source of philosophical and technical truth.</p>

<h3 id="programming-language-package-management-specific">Programming language package management specific</h3>

<p>This phenomena is already exploding in the world of programming language
package management.</p>

<p>The speed and granularity at which software is built today is almost
impossible to follow using the old method of packaging. The old software
release life cycle has been thrown out the window. Thus language-specific
tools were developed, not limited to installing libraries but also
software. We can now refer to the distribution offered package manager as
system-level and others as application-level or specific package managers.</p>

<p>Consequentially, the complexity and conflicts within a system has
exploded, and distribution package managers are finding it pointless
to manage and maintain anything that can already be installed via those
tools. Vice-versa, the specific tool makers are also not interested in
having what they provide included in distribution system-level package
managers.</p>

<p>Package managers that respect reproducibility, such as Nix, that we’ve
mentioned, handle such cases more cleanly as they respect the idea
of locality, everything residing withing a directory tree that isn’t
maintained by the system-level package manager.</p>

<p>Again, same conclusion here, we’re stuck with multiple package managers
that have different roles.</p>

<h3 id="going-distro-less">Going distro-less</h3>

<p>A popular topic in the container world is “distro-less”.</p>

<p>It’s about replacing everything provided in a distribution, removing
it’s customization, or building an image from scratch and maybe relying
on universal package managers or none.</p>

<p>The advantage of such containers is that they are really small and
targeted for a single purpose. This let the sysadmin have full control
of what happens on that box.</p>

<p>However, remember that there’s a huge cost to controlling everything,
just like we mentioned earlier. This moves the burden upon the sysadmin
to manage and be responsible to keep up with bugs and security updates
instead of the distribution maintainers</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>With everything we’ve presented about distributions, I hope we now have

current times.</p>

<p>What’s your opinion on this topic? Do you like the diversity? Which stack
would you use to build a distribution? What’s your take on static builds,
having users upload their own software to the repo? Do you have a solution
to the trust issue? How do you see this evolve?</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em>: It has come to my understanding that I’ve conflated the meaning
of “reproducible”, as in reproducing bit-for-bit identical software, and
“reproducible”, as in recreate the functionality of an operating system
in this article. I’ve instead taken it to mean anything that we’re sure
we could recreate functionality without breaking it, and used verifiable
as anything that is identical. Guix and nixos are currently accomplishing
the functionality part.</p>

<h4><a href="https://blog.ovalerio.net/archives/1880">CSP headers using Cloudflare Workers</a>

<span class="date">March 28, 2020 12:35 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Last January I made a small post about setting up a &#8220;Content-Security-Policy&#8221; header for this blog. On that post I described the steps I took to reach a final result, that I thought was good enough given the &#8220;threats&#8221; this website faces. </p>



<p>This process usually isn&#8217;t hard If you develop the website&#8217;s software and have an high level of control over the development decisions, the end result ends up being a simple yet very strict policy. However if you do not have that degree of control over the code (and do not want to break the functionality) the policy can end up more complex and lax than you were initially hoping for. That&#8217;s what happened in my case, since I currently use a standard installation of WordPress for the blog. </p>



<p>The end result was a different security policy for different routes and sections (this part was not included on the blog post), that made the web-server configuration quite messy.</p>



<p><em>(With this intro, you might have already noticed that I&#8217;m just making excuses to redo the initial and working implementation, in order to test some sort of new technology)</em></p>



<p>Given the blog is behind the Cloudflare CDN and they introduced their &#8220;serverless&#8221; product called &#8220;Workers&#8221; a while ago, I decided that I could try to manage the policy dynamically on their servers.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Browser &lt;--> CF Edge Server &lt;--> Web Server &lt;--> App</code></pre>



<p>The above line describes the current setup, so instead of adding the CSP header on the &#8220;App&#8221; or the &#8220;Web Server&#8221; stages, the header is now added to the response on the last stage before reaching the browser. Let me describe how I&#8217;ve done it.</p>



<h2>Cloudflare Workers</h2>



<p>First a very small introduction to Workers, later you can find more detailed information on <a href="https://workers.dev">Workers.dev</a>. </p>



<p>So, first Cloudflare added the <a href="https://v8.dev/">v8 engine</a> to all edge servers that route the traffic of their clients, then more recently they started letting these users write small programs that can run on those servers inside the v8 sandbox.</p>



<p>The programs are built very similarly to how you would build a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-service-worker">service worker</a> (they use the same API), the main difference being where the code runs (browser vs edge server).</p>



<p>These &#8220;serverless&#8221; scripts can then be called directly through a specific endpoint provided by Cloudflare. In this case they should create and return a response to the requests. </p>



<p>Or you can instruct Cloudflare to execute them on specific routes of your website, this means that the worker can generate the response, execute any action before the request reaches your website or change  the response that is returned.</p>



<p>This service is charged based on the number of requests handled by the &#8220;workers&#8221;.</p>



<h2>The implementation</h2>



<p>Going back to the original problem and based on the above description, we can dynamically introduce or modify the &#8220;Content-Security-Policy&#8221; for each request that goes through the worker which give us an high degree of flexibility.</p>



<p>So for my case a simple script like the one below, did the job just fine.  </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Forward the request and swap the response's CSP header
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  let policy = "&lt;your-custom-policy-here>"
  let originalResponse = await fetch(request)
  response = new Response(originalResponse.body, originalResponse)
  response.headers.set('Content-Security-Policy', policy)
  return response
}</code></pre>



<p>The script just listens for the request, passes it to a handler function (lines 1-3), forwards to the origin server (line 12), grabs the response (line 13), replaced the CSP header with the defined policy (line 14) and then returns the response.</p>



<p>If I needed something more complex, like making slight changes to the policy depending on the <code>User-Agent</code> to make sure different browsers behave as expected given the different implementations or compatibility issues, it would also be easy. This is something that would be harder to achieve in the config file of a regular web server (nginx, apache, etc).</p>



<h2>Enabling the worker</h2>



<p>Now that the script is done and the worker deployed, in order to make it run on certain requests to my blog, I just had to go to the Cloudflare&#8217;s dashboard of my domain, click on the &#8220;workers&#8221; section and add the routes I want it to be executed:</p>



<img src="https://blog.ovalerio.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cf-worker-routes.png" alt="cloudflare workers routes modal" class="wp-image-1896" />Configuring the routes that will use the worker



<p>The settings displayed on the above picture will run the worker on all requests to this blog, but is can be made more specific and I can even have multiple workers for different routes.</p>



<h2>Some sort of conclusion</h2>



<p>Despite the use-case described in this post being very simple, there is potential in this new &#8220;serverless&#8221; offering from Cloudflare. It definitely helped me solve the problem of having different policies for different sections of the website without much trouble. </p>



<p>In the future I might comeback to it, to explore other user-cases or implementation details.  </p></div>

<p><em>Note: These are a few slightly melodramatic thoughts written in the aftermath
of several somewhat traumatic weeks involving a pandemic, an earthquake, and a
substantial change in the everyday. The few links that are scattered around I
find interesting and important; the rest is here as a permanent reminder to
myself. Hope everyone's well. Wash your hands.</em></p>
<p>I had hoped I would be able to write the word "crisis" in singular in the title
of this post, but life tends to be a prescriptivist bastard. Writing this in the
middle of a pandemic, after a non-catastrophic, yet devastating earthquake in
Zagreb on Sunday, feels surreal. The apartment I just recently moved into
roughed up, parts of it possibly significantly damaged, unable to socialize
even in the most mundane of ways, exams canceled. Two events tearing into the
fabric of what one considers the most social and the most personal, at the same
time... and I'm lucky to be healthy, safe, and sound.</p>
<p>It's interesting how disruptive events quickly redefine the "normal". Just a few
weeks ago, no one could imagine being quarantined indefinitely, yet here we are
in week one of being unable to leave our place of residence. Redefining <em>normal</em>
also tends to give way to malice, as we witness more and more calls to increase
surveillance and invade people's privacy in order to (at least formally) keep
track of the spread and unwanted public gatherings. Once again the political
emerges as inseparable from the technological to the detriment of the
techno-elite. Go figure.</p>
<p>Science, with all of its problems, gives us hope. Both of these events have been
properly assessed: epidemiologists and infectious disease experts have been
warning us of the possible consequences of SARS-CoV-2 weeks before the situation
got out of control outside of China, and seismologists have been fairly clear
that a strong earthquake around Zagreb is imminent. The problem with complex
systems is that they're hard to grasp even for experts, and our intuition for
statistics is slim to none. Even when we do manage to become aware of some
aspects of the risks involved, <a href="https://mindhacks.com/2020/03/20/do-we-suffer-behavioural-fatigue-for-pandemic-prevention-measures/">this tends to fall apart as quickly as it
materializes</a>.
Coupled with the fear of "collapsing markets" and their existential
consequences, this often means we're more comfortable with the status quo than
with taking action. Informed apathy can be as dangerous as uninformed sympathy.</p>
<hr />
<p>As an aside, existential terror is a powerful weapon, and it was interesting to
observe its effects on one's thoughts and approaches to life. I am well-aware
that there are no reliable methods of predicting earthquakes to any precise
extent, yet when on the day of the earthquake someone blurted out a hoax that
"there's a stronger one coming at 8:45am", for a few moments it seemed like the
most inevitable and obvious thing in the world. I think I've revisited that
highly instructive moment more often than the earthquake itself.</p>
<hr />
<p>Even though it's impossible not to be affected by this, people in IT, and
primarily in software, seem to be in a unique position to handle this situation
better than the average worker. There <strong>will</strong> be consequences, but the vast
amount of money in tech means there's less chance of being fired, especially in
times of enormous reliance on the tech infrastructure. The level of
technological literacy gives us an enormous advantage in navigating the
inevitable mess during the initial period of adjustment. A lot of us have been
able to seamlessly switch to working from home, if we haven't already been doing
so.</p>
<p>I believe this gives us a fair deal of responsibility, too: it's increasingly
important to use our skills to help the ones in need. Large-scale tragedies take
a psychological and organizational toll, and <a href="https://coronavirustechhandbook.com/home">we have tools to
help</a>. This means
being aware of the fact that the technology we produce is not as obvious as it
might seem, and that people often need assistance and support which isn't a sign
of weakness or lack of competence, but rather a natural consequence of using a
new tool in an unfamiliar setting. It also means using the free time that
isolation gives us to help people and organizations by providing them with
necessary technological infrastructure and assistance.</p>
<p>More in-depth political analyses have been written by more eloquent and
better-read comrades over at <a href="https://syllabus.pirate.care/topic/coronanotes/">Pirate Care, focused on COVID-19 in
particular</a>, and by <a href="http://tom.medak.click/posts/earthquake/">Tomislav, focused
on the pandemic in combination with the
earthquake</a>. I can just echo that I
find it important not to let our imagination atrophy and our empathy to subside,
and that I hope the lessons we learn here will be the ones of solidarity and
care. ☭</p></div>

<p>I recently finished a major visual overhaul of my current pet project, <a href="https://www.gloriousvoiceleader.com/">Glorious Voice Leader</a>. The redesign was primarily intended to give musicians a (hopefully) more natural interface for working with the tool.</p>

<p>Originally, <a href="https://www.gloriousvoiceleader.com/">Glorious Voice Leader</a> displayed its chord suggestions as a series of horizontal fretboards stacked vertically:</p>

  <p>The old Glorious Voice Leader.</p>
</div>

<p>This gave the guitarist lots of control, but it wasn’t a natural way for them to interact with or consume a chord progression.</p>

<p>Instead, I decided to transition to a more familiar chart-based design where every chord in the progression is represented by a small chord chart that should be familiar to any guitarist. The chord currently being added or modified is also displayed on a full fretboard laid out vertically on the side of the page:</p>

<div>

  <p>The newly redesigned Glorious Voice Leader.</p>
</div>

<p>The redesign was largely a cosmetic overhaul. A few new minor features were added in the process, such as progressive chord naming, and better keyboard controls, but the meat of <a href="https://www.gloriousvoiceleader.com/">Glorious Voice Leader</a> is all still there. Your old saved URLs will still work!</p>

<p>How would you describe yourself?<br />
How do you usually talk about yourself?<br />
Do you feel like you are the writer of your own narrative?<br />
Who are you?</p>

<p>We all stand on a balance of being perceived and perceiving, of having
a visible and owning an invisible part, and of having control over and
being controlled by. It is amongst all this that we can find the nebulous
definition of who we are, what Locke calls “the sameness of a rational
being”.<br />
In view of this, we are both passengers and conductors of our
narrative. So how do we drive this narrative forward, is it possible
to have more agency in it than we currently have. And if we are our
narrative can we, as the narrative, choose another narrative without
self-annihilation.<br />
Metacognition can be dizzying.</p>

<p>I’ve previously discussed the topic of <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/philosophy/2016/07/17/what-are-we.html">what we
are</a>
and now I’d like to focus on the self, its formation, its transformation,
and its actualization.</p>

<p>Who one is, over time, is created by the amalgamation of the historical
events, physical aspects, and external and internal reflections, that get
incorporated into one’s identity. The self is this element that sits in
the middle, taking in and taking out, what makes sense to us and for us.</p>

<p>From an external point of view, we could define ourselves in reaction to
the roles we play for others, the way we interact with them, eventually
adjusting our selves to the labels we’ve been given or have chosen.<br />
It is helpful to have others act as calibration to our internal system
when we have nothing else to base our definition unto, especially when
we are starting with our self exploration in teenage years. We aren’t
brains in a vat, a self doesn’t exist without a world. Yet, if we overly
emphasize on this sort of self definition, <em>the other</em> becomes our worse
nightmare and our only way of finding meaning and salvation. It leads
to interpreting the world with a heavy filter, and judge it the way we
think it judges us, harshly, and frequently inaccurately, because it is
shaped by our individual self-concept and personal biases. This is what
we call metaperception, the idea we have of how other people’s view of us.</p>

<p>Metaperception can be destructive if not handled properly. For instance,
someone who fixates on it may act in a self-centered way, imagining
that everyone is watching and evaluating their every move, that they
are the center of social interaction. They’ll shut themselves, limit
their spontaneity, and have an increasingly fragile ego. All the while,
not considering the unbridgeable gap that exists between selves.<br />
Being overwhelmed by <em>the other</em> makes it difficult to accept criticism,
to interpret someone else’s response; everything becomes emotionally
charged in a frenzied uncontrollable internal state.</p>

<p>From an internal point of view, we could defined ourselves as the main
character of our lives, the maker of the story. We could move in the
world in relation to what we perceive we’re doing to it.<br />
We are our own persons, with our own choices, so why not make the world
what we want of it. Yet, if we overly emphasize on this sort of self
definition, we become an actor, the protagonist, reading the main script,
trying to get the center of the stage, while everyone around plays a minor
role. It leads to clashes in narratives, cognitive dissonance, an illusion
of superiority, and an egocentric bias. Just like over-metaperception
creates lenses, the self-made-story does too. We cannot deny that, by
analogical thinking, others exist and that they have their own selves.</p>

<p>Therefore, that’s where the balance lies: knowing that we can be the masters
of our destinies, and knowing we are creatures living in a limited social
and physical world.<br />
How do we learn to be comfortable with the ambiguity of the self/other
boundary and get a better life experience. Why and how do we change
our selves.</p>

<p>Change is hard. It’s an arduous task we’d rather let happen
by itself gradually, let it pass by, barely noticing it after it has
happened. Unfortunately, life is riddled with issues and dissatisfactions.<br />
At first, we may pretend they are benign, non-existent, trivial. We
dismiss them and move on to do activities that take our focus away from
them…<br />
Until they are not trivial anymore, until our behavioral pattern becomes
destructive, until they become unmanageable, until we become intimately
aware of them.<br />
Then a realization emerges: Those problems are created by our sense of self,
they are the product of our definition, part of the narrative. Rejecting
them would mean rejecting one self. And this is what we do, we build
immunity to change, we protect our self consistence, we cocoon ourselves
away from the unknown changes. This is what we are and we feel stuck
with it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The years pass by and nothing seems to change. - Henry David Thoreau</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gradually, we may build constant feelings of guilt, shame, anxiety, and
regret. Desperate for change we see as unattainable, seeing everything
as an unfulfilling experience. Are we to forever remain haunted by what
might have been?</p>

<p>To cope with such emotions, we could rely on our old friend:
self-suppressive escapism. Namely, anything that is numbing, numbing to
the critical evaluation of the self, a cognitive narrowing, a cognitive
detachment from the disturbing elements of the self. All of this being
the easiest way to avoid the source of despair. Moreover, in themselves,
these kinds of actions could be blamed for our current state. We can
blame our inability to take productive actions to change on our anxiety,
depression, fear, or lack of confidence in our abilities. Additionally,
we may even believe that we have to first get rid of such feelings
before moving on to change, we’ll try meditation and introspection. Or
we may believe that we’ve wasted too much time, that it’s too late,
and be overwhelmed by intense feelings of guilt and regret. However,
the negative emotions are not the results of those but they are inherent
to the way we define ourselves and our fear of change.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any obstruction of the natural processes of development …or getting
stuck on a level unsuited to one’s age, takes its revenge, if not
immediately, then later at the onset of the second half of life, in the
form of serious crises, nervous breakdowns, and all manner of physical
and psychic sufferings. Mostly they are accompanied by vague feelings
of guilt, by tormenting pangs of conscience, often not understood, in
face of which the individual is helpless. He knows he is not guilty of
any bad deed, he has not given way to an illicit impulse, and yet he is
plagued by uncertainty, discontent, despair, and above all by anxiety
– a constant, indefinable anxiety. And in truth he must usually be
pronounced “guilty”. His guilt does not lie in the fact that he has
a neurosis, but in the fact that, knowing he has one, he does nothing
to set about curing it. - Jolande Jacobi, The Way of Individuation</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We cannot change anything unless we accept it. - Carl Jung</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, we should find the courage to tackle personal growth. If we don’t
accept what has been, we can’t move to what will be. The feelings of
dissatisfaction should be the catalyst of change, they should be welcomed
as stimuli in the struggle for the development of personality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Neurotic symptoms such as these are a direct result of an inadequate
approach to life and act as signals communicating the necessity of
change. - Carl Jung</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Small changes are great and cumulate but when we’ve reached a point
where each step forward gets repelled by all our insecurities, we need
more assurance, we need to know which sort of exact self-induced changes
are the most useful.<br />
And this is what we need to do, we need to break our immunity to change,
we need to remove the shield of our self consistence, we need to face
the unknown changes right on. This is the step where we need to take
the courage to sacrifice our selves to be reborn.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sacrifice always means the renunciation of a valuable part of oneself,
and through it the sacrificer escapes being devoured.
Difficult but necessary step to abandon an aspect of ourself in order
to pave the way for the emergence of the new. The sacrifice is critical
in the process of rebirth because what keeps us locked in our problem
is the inability to recognize that ways of life that served us in our
past may morph from promoters of our well being to the acute cause of
our suffering. - Carl Jung</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>…The dying of one attitude or need may be the other side of the birth
of something new. One an choose to kill a neurotic strategy, a dependency,
a clinging, and then find that he can choose to live as a freer self… A
“dying” of part of one’s self is often followed by a heightened awareness
of self, a heightened sense of possibility. - Rollo May</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unsurprisingly, any sudden unnatural change involves risks, especially
when already deep into the abyss. Such change may lead to disorder if,
by removing part of ourselves, we have nothing else to fill it with. This
may take us to the path of chaos and psychological breakdown.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[This] …is similar in principle to a psychotic disturbance; that is, it
differs from the initial stage of mental illness only by the fact that
it leads in the end to greater health, while the latter leads to yet
greater destruction. - Carl Jung</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enters a labyrinth, and multiplies a thousandfold the dangers that life
in itself brings with it - of which not the least is that nobody can see
how and where he loses his way, becomes solitary, and is torn to pieces
by some cave-Minotaur of conscience. - Nietzsche</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now that we’re aware of our situation and have the courage to leap
and let ourselves go, how do we direct the change and get out of the
loop we’re currently stuck in, how do we stop being an immovable pillar
of the past.</p>

<p>Just like we’ve accepted that parts of the self can be sacrificed, we
have to accept its ambiguity and its chaotic nature. Accept that there’s
a world within us that we may not currently understand, that there’s a
depth in each of us that remains to be discovered. We have to be aware
of the reality of our psyche.<br />
Indeed, a lot of the reasons why it remains hidden are related to the
self-suppression we externally exert on elements of our personality that
we think run counter to the moral system of our days. We are blinded by
the unquestioned social beliefs and standards.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All psychology so far has got hung up on moral prejudices and fears:
it has not dared to descend into the depths. - Nietzsche</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, how can we know ourselves if we are actors in a play, wearer
of the masks of society. How can we know ourselves if all we strive for
is fake-perfectionism, a fetishism for perfection and a repulsion for
anything that isn’t. Perfection hinders our development.<br />
Consequentially, we have to accept that perfection is not a thing to aim
for, that it is non-existent. Because how can one know what perfection
is if it is not complete to begin with.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One should never think that man can reach perfection, he can only aim
at completion - not to be perfect but to be complete. That would be the
necessity and the indispensable condition if there were only question of
perfection at all. For how can you perfect a thing if it is not complete?</p>

  <p>Make it complete first and see what it is then. But to make it complete
is already a mountain of a task, and by the time you arrive at absolute
completion, you find that you are already dead, so you never read that
preliminary condition for perfecting yourself.  - Carl Jung</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Completeness means grasping the wholeness of the self, the inner
foundation of one’s mind, how to impose form and harmony on the chaos
that is the totality of the self. We are chaos.<br />
We are composed of a multitude, and we need to make those emerge, to
bring the parts to light. As much as we dig, as much as the elements of
consciousness become apparent. We should do all we can to promote
this growth, we should be heroes and explorers of the chaos not passive
observers that are controlled by its forces. The myriads of chunks
are then seen from afar, for what they are, none taking authority on
the whole.<br />
Just like the body is coordinated, there can be a master to the chaos
of the mind. We can have an organizing idea that drives the rest. But
what is this drive, how do we cultivate it, how can we muster its power
to train the body it’s composed of.</p>

<p>If we keep experimenting and spend time bringing forward the chaotic
parts to understand them, it becomes clear. Our drives don’t come out
of thin air. Analogically to the reframing of the definition of the self,
we can reframe our connection to space and time.<br />
We are part of our history, our dreams, our will of achievements, our
unconscious thoughts, our past cultures, our institutions, our traditions,
our physical predispositions, our limits, our sense of imminent death, and
our primitive drives, all constitute our location in space-time. Those are
also expressions of our personal and collective unconscious. Altogether,
those create a common symbolic language, archetypes, universal elements,
original forms that are part of the specification of human nature.<br />
When one becomes conscious of their link with archetypes, they gain
knowledge of the timeless “pattern of human life”, it provides a link with
humanity. Additionally, this type of learning dissolves the feeling that
everything is absurd and provides a sense of being rooted.<br />
Considering this, we need to actively learn about basic prehistorical
drives and how we can take power over them, we need to learn about history
and how it repeats itself, we need to be familiar with the vestiges of
the past, feel them flow within us instead of being ashamed and repressing
them. The ruling passion should drive it all, sculpting our own heroic
meaning to life.</p>

<p>For that, we can choose to study examples of archetypes, anyone and
anything that we find excels in life, be it an imaginary being or
not. Like an artist, we can be active makers, using the same method that
gave birth to our self in the first place: imitation and emulation of the
others. We can create a second self based on traits, characteristics,
and how they handle adversity and challenges, of a role model while
still respecting what we know we can’t change in ourselves, our innate
strength and weaknesses.<br />
This mechanism, of having an alter-ego archetype as a feedback mechanism
that we slowly dissolve into, makes escapism easier and directed. Instead
of reaching for the numbing actions we should reach for the second self
we’ve created. Importantly keeping in mind that one of those numbing
action is to divulge to others that we are simple “acting it out”,
informing others would only be a sign of the anxiety we are having when
facing this novel situation and that we are looking for the recalibration
of our social norms via <em>the others</em>.<br />
We should not pretend, we should act as if we already were and remind
ourselves constantly, when we fall back to our old habits, that the past
was the actual acting and that the present is the reality.</p>

<p>All of this until we engender the shift in our mindset. We’ll finally
be a new self, looking above the previous one from a distance. It’s only
by taking a distance that we can understand the whole.<br />
Thus, we can continue on our self discovery, peeling more and more,
revealing potential we didn’t know we had. At this point we can rediscover
our internal and external worlds like never before. Introspection,
retrospection, discussion, connection of the minds, these take on a
different perspective: what we call psychological mindedness.</p>

<p>The field of developmental psychology has been enamored with such
encapsulated form of growth, subject/object, the one where as you move
along the previous self becomes the object of the current self or where
you radically change your perspective on life. For instance, Abraham
Maslow, Jean Piaget, Erik Erikson, Robert Kegan, are psychologists that
used such methods to convey cognitive and personality development.</p>

<p>Maslow talks about self-actualization, “man’s tendency to
actualize himself, to become his potentialities”, “the desire for
self-fulfillment”. This can be achieve by having something to aim at,
not for external rewards or achievement of the goal but rather because
the transformation of the self forces us to do it. The type of behavior
that requires self-discipline, skills, and that is constructive.<br />
Piaget and Kegan focus on the subject-object and inter-relation when it
comes to defining the self. Giving a sense to the self in a world that
is nebulous and has roots in history.<br />
Erikson prefers to emphasize what is important at every stage of life,
the “ego identities”, from childhood to senior years, all together
encompassing a stable self. Putting in perspective our common humanity.</p>

</pre>

<p>Finally, maybe eventually, with all this, we can know who we are and
how to describe ourselves.</p>

<p>Mention concurrency and you’re bound to get two kinds of unsolicited advice: first that it’s a nightmarish problem which will melt your brain, and second that there’s a magical programming language or niche paradigm which will make all your problems disappear.</p>
<p>We won’t run to either extreme here. Instead we’ll cover the production workhorses for concurrent software – threading and locking – and learn about them through a series of interesting programs. By the end of this article you’ll know the terminology and patterns used by POSIX threads (pthreads).</p>
<p>This is an introduction rather than a reference. Plenty of reference material exists for pthreads – whole books in fact. I won’t dwell on all the options of the API, but will briskly give you the big picture. None of the examples contain error handling because it would merely clutter them.</p>

<h3 id="concurrency-vs-parallelism">Concurrency vs parallelism</h3>
<p>First it’s important to distinguish concurrency vs parallelism. <strong>Concurrency</strong> is the ability of parts of a program to work correctly when executed out of order. For instance, imagine tasks A and B. One way to execute them is sequentially, meaning doing all steps for A, then all for B:</p>

 A  B

<p>Concurrent execution, on the other hand, alternates doing a little of each task until both are all complete:</p>

        

<p>Concurrency allows a program to make progress even when certain parts are blocked. For instance, when one task is waiting for user input, the system can switch to another task and do calculations.</p>
<p>When tasks don’t just interleave, but run at the same time, that’s called <strong>parallelism</strong>. Multiple CPU cores can run instructions simultaneously:</p>

 A  B

<p>When a program – even without hardware parallelism – switches rapidly enough from one task to another, it can feel to the user that tasks are executing at the same time. You could say it provides the “illusion of parallelism.” However, true parallelism has the potential for greater processor throughput for problems that can be broken into independent subtasks. Some ways of dealing with concurrency, such as multi-threaded programming, can exploit hardware parallelism automatically when available.</p>
<p>Some languages (or more accurately, some language implementations) are unable to achieve true multi-threaded parallelism. Ruby MRI and CPython for instance use a global interpreter lock (GIL) to simplify their implementation. The GIL prevents more than one thread from running at once. Programs in these interpreters can benefit from I/O concurrency, but not extra computational power.</p>
<h3 id="our-first-concurrent-program">Our first concurrent program</h3>
<p>Languages and libraries offer different ways to add concurrency to a program. UNIX for instance has a bunch of disjointed mechanisms like signals, asynchronous I/O (AIO), select, poll, and setjmp/longjmp. Using these mechanisms can complicate program structure and make programs harder to read than sequential code.</p>
<p>Threads offer a cleaner and more consistent way to address these motivations. For I/O they’re usually clearer than polling or callbacks, and for processing they are more efficient than Unix processes.</p>
<h4 id="crazy-bankers">Crazy bankers</h4>
<p>Let’s get started by adding concurrency to a program to simulate a bunch of crazy bankers sending random amounts of money from one bank account to another. The bankers don’t communicate with one another, so this is a demonstration of concurrency without synchronization.</p>
<p>Adding concurrency is the easy part. The real work is in making threads wait for one another to ensure a correct result. We’ll see a number of mechanisms and patterns for synchronization later, but for now let’s see what goes wrong without synchronization.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
Note: building with gcc
</h4>
<p>
Most compilers work correctly with <code>-lpthread</code> but GCC is unusual and requires <code>-pthreads</code>. For portability we could attempt to use the POSIX <code>c99</code> compiler interface. In fact the latest standard <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/c99.html#tagtcjh_25"> provides</a> configuration variables containing the proper pthreads compiler options for whatever platform compiler underlies this interface:

<ul>
<li>
POSIX_V7_THREADS_CFLAGS
</li>
<li>
POSIX_V7_THREADS_LDFLAGS
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Makefiles would use <code>getconf</code> to retrieve these values and add them to CFLAGS and LDFLAGS. However the feature is too new to be supported by most systems. You’ll have to modify the Makefile manually for now if you’re in nonstandard GNU land.

<h3 id="data-races">Data races</h3>
<p>Try compiling and running <code>banker.c</code>. Notice anything strange?</p>
<p>Threads share memory directly. Each thread can read and write variables in shared memory without any overhead. However when threads simultaneously read and write the same data it’s called a <strong>data race</strong> and generally causes problems.</p>
<p>In particular, threads in <code>banker.c</code> have data races when they read and write account balances. The bankers program moves money between accounts, however the total amount of money in the system does not remain constant. The books don’t balance. Exactly how the program behaves depends on thread scheduling policies of the operating system. On OpenBSD the total money seldom stays at $1,000. Sometimes money gets duplicated, sometimes it vanishes. On macOS the result is generally that all the money disappears, or even becomes negative!</p>
<p>The property that money is neither created nor destroyed in a bank is an example of a <strong>program invariant</strong>, and it gets violated by data races. Note that parallelism is not required for a race, only concurrency.</p>
<p>Here’s the problematic code in the <code>disburse()</code> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">payment = <span class="dv">1</span> + rand_range(accts[from].balance);
accts[from].balance -= payment;
accts[to].balance   += payment;</code></pre></div>
<p>The threads running this code can be paused or interleaved at any time. Not just between any of the statements, but partway through arithmetic operations which may not execute atomically on the hardware. Never rely on “thread inertia,” which is the mistaken feeling that the thread will finish a group of statements without interference.</p>
<p>Let’s examine exactly how statements can interleave between banker threads, and the resulting problems. The columns of the table below are threads, and the rows are moments in time.</p>
<p>Here’s a timeline where two threads read the same account balance when planning how much money to transfer. It can cause an overdraft.</p>

<p>Similar problems can occur when bankers have a data race in destination accounts. Races in the destination account would tend to decrease total money supply. (To learn more about concurrency problems, see my article <a href="https://begriffs.com/posts/2017-08-01-practical-guide-sql-isolation.html">Practical Guide to SQL Transaction Isolation</a>).</p>
<h3 id="locks-and-deadlock">Locks and deadlock</h3>
<p>In the example above, we found that a certain section of code was vulnerable to data races. Such tricky parts of a program are called <strong>critical sections.</strong> We must ensure each thread gets all the way through the section before another thread is allowed to enter it.</p>
<p>To give threads mutually exclusive access to a critical section, pthreads provides the mutually exclusive lock (<strong>mutex</strong> for short). The pattern is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;some_mutex);

<span class="co">/* ... do things in the critical section ... */</span>

pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;some_mutex);</code></pre></div>
<p>Any thread calling <code>pthread_mutex_lock</code> on a previously locked mutex will go to sleep and not be scheduled until the mutex is unlocked (and any other threads already waiting on the mutex have gone first).</p>
<p>Another way to look at mutexes is that their job is to preserve program invariants. The critical section between locking and unlocking is a place where a certain invariant may be temporarily broken, as long as it is restored by the end. Some people recommend adding an <code>assert()</code> statement before unlocking, to help document the invariant. If an invariant is difficult to specify in an assertion, a comment can be useful instead.</p>
<p>A function is called <strong>thread-safe</strong> if multiple invocations can safely run concurrently. A cheap, but inefficient, way to make any function thread-safe is to give it its own mutex and lock it right away:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="co">/* inefficient but effective way to protect a function */</span>

pthread_mutex_t foo_mtx = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

<span class="dt">void</span> foo(<span class="co">/* some arguments */</span>)
{
	pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;foo_mtx);

	<span class="co">/* we're safe in here, but it's a bottleneck */</span>

	pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;foo_mtx);
}</code></pre></div>
<p>To see why this is inefficient, imagine if <code>foo()</code> was designed to output characters to a file specified in its arguments. Because the function takes a global lock, no two threads could run it at once, even if they wanted to write to different files. Writing to different files should be independent activities, and what we really want to protect against are two threads concurrently writing the <em>same</em> file.</p>
<p>The amount of data that a mutex protects is called its <strong>granularity,</strong> and smaller granularity can often be more efficient. In our <code>foo()</code> example, we could store a mutex for every file we write, and have the function choose and lock the appropriate mutex. Multi-threaded programs typically add a mutex as a member variable to data structures, to associate the lock with its data.</p>
<p>Let’s update the banker program to keep a mutex in each account and prevent data races.</p>

	printf(<span class="st">&quot;Total money in system: %ld</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, total);
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Now everything should be safe. No money being created or destroyed, just perfect exchanges between the accounts. The invariant is that the total balance of the source and destination accounts is the same before we transfer the money as after. It’s broken only inside the critical section.</p>
<p>As a side note, at this point you might think it would be more efficient be to take a single lock at a time, like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>lock the source account</li>
<li>withdraw money into a thread local variable</li>
<li>unlock the source account</li>
<li>(danger zone!)</li>
<li>lock the destination account</li>
<li>deposit the money</li>
<li>unlock the destination account</li>
</ul>
<p>This would not be safe. During the time between unlocking the source account and locking the destination, the invariant does not hold, yet another thread could observe this state. For instance a report running in another thread just at that time could read the balance of both accounts and observe money missing from the system.</p>
<p>We do need to lock both accounts during the transfer. However the way we’re doing it causes a different problem. Try to run the program. It gets stuck forever and never prints the final balance! Its threads are <strong>deadlocked.</strong></p>
<p>Deadlock is the second villain of concurrent programming, and happens when threads wait on each others’ locks, but no thread unlocks for any other. The case of the bankers is a classic simple form called the <strong>deadly embrace.</strong> Here’s how it plays out:</p>
<table class="table">

</table>
<p>The problem happens because threads lock resources in different orders, and because they refuse to give locks up. We can solve the problem by addressing either of these causes.</p>
<p>The first approach to preventing deadlock is to enforce a <strong>locking hierarchy.</strong> This means the programmer comes up with an arbitrary order for locks, and always takes “earlier” locks before “later” ones. The terminology comes from locks in hierarchical data structures like trees, but it really amounts to using any kind of consistent locking order.</p>
<p>In our case of the banker program we store all the accounts in an array, so we can use the array index as the lock order. Let’s compare.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="co">/* the original way to lock mutexes, which caused deadlock */</span>

pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;accts[from].mtx);
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;accts[to].mtx);
<span class="co">/* move money */</span>
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;accts[to].mtx);
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;accts[from].mtx);</code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s a safe way, enforcing a locking hierarchy:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="co">/* lock mutexes in earlier accounts first */</span>

<span class="pp">#define MIN(a,b) ((a) &lt; (b) ? (a) : (b))</span>
<span class="pp">#define MAX(a,b) ((a) &lt; (b) ? (b) : (a))</span>

pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;accts[MIN(from, to)].mtx);
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;accts[MAX(from, to)].mtx);
<span class="co">/* move money */</span>
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;accts[MAX(from, to)].mtx);
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;accts[MIN(from, to)].mtx);

<span class="co">/* notice we unlock in opposite order */</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A locking hierarchy is the most efficient way to prevent deadlock, but it isn’t always easy to contrive. It’s also creates a potentially undocumented coupling between different parts of a program which need to collaborate in the convention.</p>
<p><strong>Backoff</strong> is a different way to prevent deadlock which works for locks taken in any order. It takes a lock, but then checks whether the next is obtainable. If not, it unlocks the first to allow another thread to make progress, and tries again.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="co">/* using pthread_mutex_trylock to dodge deadlock */</span>

<span class="cf">while</span> (<span class="dv">1</span>)
{
	pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;accts[from].mtx);
	
	<span class="cf">if</span> (pthread_mutex_trylock(&amp;accts[to].mtx) == <span class="dv">0</span>)
		<span class="cf">break</span>; <span class="co">/* got both locks */</span>

	<span class="co">/* didn't get the second one, so unlock the first */</span>
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;accts[from].mtx);
	<span class="co">/* force a sleep so another thread can try --</span>
<span class="co">	   include &lt;sched.h&gt; for this function */</span>
	sched_yield();
}
<span class="co">/* move money */</span>
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;accts[to].mtx);
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;accts[from].mtx);</code></pre></div>
<p>One tricky part is the call to <code>sched_yield()</code>. Without it the loop will immediately try to grab the lock again, competing as hard as it can with other threads who could make more productive use of the lock. This causes <strong>livelock</strong>, where threads fight for access to the locks. The <code>sched_yield()</code> puts the calling thread to sleep and at the back of the scheduler’s run queue.</p>
<p>Despite its flexibility, backoff is definitely less efficient than a locking hierarchy because it can make wasted calls to lock and unlock mutexes. Try modifying the banker program with these approaches and measure how fast they run.</p>
<h3 id="condition-variables">Condition variables</h3>
<p>After safely getting access to a shared variable with a mutex, a thread may discover that the value of the variable is not yet suitable for the thread to act upon. For instance, if the thread was looking for an item to process in a shared queue, but found the queue was empty. The thread could poll the value, but this is inefficient. Pthreads provides <strong>condition variables</strong> to allow threads to wait for events of interest or notify other threads when these events happen.</p>
<p>Condition variables are not themselves locks, nor do they hold any value of their own. They are merely events with a programmer-assigned meaning. For example, a structure representing a queue could have a mutex for safely accessing the data, plus some condition variables. One to represent the event of the queue becoming empty, and another to announce when a new item is added.</p>
<p>Before getting deeper into how condition variables work, let’s see one in action with our banker program. We’ll measure contention between the bankers. First we’ll increase the number of threads and accounts, and keep statistics about how many bankers manage to get inside the <code>disburse()</code> critical section at once. Any time the max score is broken, we’ll signal a condition variable. A dedicated thread will wait on it and update a scoreboard.</p>

}</code></pre></div>
<p>With fifty accounts and a hundred threads, not all threads will be able to be in the critical section of <code>disburse()</code> at once. It varies between runs. Run the program and see how well it does on your machine. (One complication is that making all threads synchronize on <code>stats_mtx</code> may throw off the measurement, because there are threads who could have executed independently but now must interact.)</p>
<p>Let’s look at how to properly use condition variables. We notified threads of a new event with <code>pthread_cond_broadcast(&amp;stats_cnd)</code>. This function marks all threads waiting on <code>state_cnd</code> as ready to run.</p>
<p>Sometimes multiple threads are waiting on a single cond var. A broadcast will wake them all, but sometimes the event source knows that only one thread will be able to do any work. For instance if only one item is added to a shared queue. In that case the <code>pthread_cond_signal</code> function is better than <code>pthread_cond_broadcast</code>. Unnecessarily waking multiple threads causes overhead. In our case we know that only one thread is waiting on the cond var, so it really makes no difference.</p>
<p>Remember that it’s never <em>wrong</em> to use a broadcast, whereas in some cases it might be wrong to use a signal. Signal is just an optimized broadcast.</p>
<p>The waiting side of a cond var ought always to have this pattern:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mutex);
<span class="cf">while</span> (!PREDICATE)
	pthread_cond_wait(&amp;cond_var, &amp;mutex);
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;mutex);</code></pre></div>
<p>Condition variables are always associated with a predicate, and the association is implicit in the programmer’s head. You shouldn’t reuse a condition variable for multiple predicates. The intention is that code will signal the cond var when the predicate becomes true.</p>
<p>Before testing the predicate we lock a mutex that covers the data being tested. That way no other thread can change the data immediately after we test it (also <code>pthread_cond_wait()</code> requires a locked mutex). If the predicate is already true we needn’t wait on the cond var, so the loop falls through, otherwise the thread begins to wait.</p>
<p>Condition variables allow you to make this series of events atomic: unlock a mutex, register our interest in the event, and block. Without that atomicity another thread might awaken to take our lock and broadcast before we’ve registered ourselves as interested. Without the atomicity we could be blocked forever.</p>
<p>When <code>pthread_cond_wait()</code> returns, the calling thread awakens and atomically gets its mutex back. It’s all set to check the predicate again in the loop. But why check the predicate? Wasn’t the cond var signaled because the predicate was true, and isn’t the relevant data protected by a mutex? There are three reasons to check:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the condition variable had been broadcast, other threads might have been listening, and another might have been scheduled first and might have done our job. The loop tests for that interception.</li>
<li>On some multiprocessor systems, making condition variable wakeup completely predictable might substantially slow down all cond var operations. Such systems allow <strong>spurious wakeups</strong>, and threads need to be prepared to check if they were woken appropriately.</li>
<li>It can be convenient to signal on a loose predicate. Threads can signal the variables when the event seems <em>likely</em>, or even mistakenly signal, and the program will still work. For instance, we signal when when <code>stats_best</code> gets a new high score, but we could have chosen to signal at every invocation of <code>stats_change()</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that we have to pass a locked mutex to <code>pthread_cond_wait()</code>, which we had to create, why don’t cond vars come with their own built-in mutex? The reason is flexibility. Although you should use only one mutex with a cond var, there can be multiple cond vars for the same mutex.

<h4 id="barriers">Barriers</h4>
<p>It’s time to bid farewell to the banker programs, and turn to something more lively: Conway’s Game of Life! The game has a set of rules operating on a grid of cells that determines which cells live or die based on how many living neighbors each has.</p>
<p>The game can take advantage of multiple processors, using each processor to operate on a different part of the grid in parallel. It’s a so-called <strong>embarrassingly parallel</strong> problem because each section of the grid can be processed in isolation, without needing results from other sections.</p>
<p>Barriers ensure that all threads have reached a particular stage in a parallel computation before allowing any to proceed to the next stage. Each thread calls <code>pthread_barrier_wait()</code> to rendezvous with the others. One of the threads, chosen randomly, will see the <code>PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD</code> return value, which nominates that thread to do any cleanup or preparation between stages.</p>

<p>It’s a fun example although slightly contrived. We’re adding a sleep between rounds to slow down the animation, so it’s unnecessary to chase parallelism. Also there’s a memoized algorithm called hashlife we should be using if pure speed is the goal. However our code illustrates a natural use for barriers.</p>
<p>Notice how we wait at the barrier twice in rapid succession. After emerging from the first barrier, one of the threads (chosen at random) copies the new state to the board and draws it. The other threads run ahead to the next barrier and wait there so they don’t cause a data race writing to the board. Once the drawing thread arrives at the barrier with them, then all can proceed to calculate cells’ fate for the next round.</p>
<p>Barriers are guaranteed to be present in POSIX.1-2008, but are optional in earlier versions of the standard. Notably macOS is stuck at an old version of POSIX. Presumably they’re too busy “innovating” with their keyboard touchbar to invest in operating system fundamentals.</p>
<h4 id="spinlocks">Spinlocks</h4>
<p>Spinlocks are implementations of mutexes optimized for fine-grained locking. Often used in low level code like drivers or operating systems, spinlocks are designed to be the most primitive and fastest sync mechanism available. They’re generally not appropriate for application programming. They are only truly necessary for situations like interrupt handlers when a thread is not allowed to go to sleep for any reason.</p>
<p>Aside from that scenario, it’s better to just use a mutex, since mutexes are pretty efficient these days. Modern mutexes often try a short-lived internal spinlock and fall back to heavier techniques only as needed. Mutexes also sometimes use a wait queue called a <strong>futex</strong>, which can take a lock in user-space whenever there is no contention from another thread.</p>
<p>When attempting to lock a spinlock, a thread runs a tight loop repeatedly checking a value in shared memory for a sign it’s safe to proceed. Spinlock implementations use special atomic assembly language instructions to test that the value is unlocked and lock it. The particular instructions vary per architecture, and can be performed in user space to avoid the overhead of a system call.</p>
<p>The while waiting for a lock, the loop doesn’t block the thread, but instead continues running and burns CPU energy. The technique works only on true multi-processor systems or a uniprocessor system with preemption enabled. On a uniprocessor system with cooperative threading the loop could never be interrupted, and will livelock.</p>
<p>In POSIX.1-2008 spinlock support is mandatory. In previous versions the presence of this feature was indicated by the <code>_POSIX_SPIN_LOCKS</code> macro. Spinlock functions start with <code>pthread_spin_</code>.</p>
<h4 id="reader-writer-locks">Reader-writer locks</h4>
<p>Whereas a mutex enforces mutual exclusion, a <strong>reader-writer lock</strong> allows concurrent read access. Multiple threads can read in parallel, but all block when a thread takes the lock for writing. The increased concurrency can improve application performance. However, blindly replacing mutexes with reader-writer locks “for performance” doesn’t work. Our earlier banker program, for instance, could suffer from duplicate withdrawals if it allowed multiple readers in an account at once.</p>
<p>Below is an rwlock example. It’s a password cracker I call 5dm (md5 backwards). It aims for maximum parallelism searching for a preimage of an MD5 hash. Worker threads periodically poll whether one among them has found an answer, and they use a reader-writer lock to avoid blocking on each other when doing so.</p>
<p>The example is slightly contrived, in that the difficulty of brute forcing passwords increases exponentially with their length. Using multiple threads reduces the time by only a constant factor – but 4x faster is still 4x faster on a four core computer!</p>
<p>The example below uses <code>MD5()</code> from OpenSSL. To build it, include <code>pkg-config --cflags libcrypto</code> in the CFLAGS and <code>pkg-config --libs libcrypto</code> in LDFLAGS. To run it, pass in an MD5 hash and max preimage search length. Note the <code>-n</code> in echo to suppress the newline, since newline is not in our search alphabet:</p>

<p>Although read-write locks can be implemented in terms of mutexes and condition variables, such implementations are significantly less efficient than is possible. Therefore, this synchronization primitive is included in POSIX.1-2008 for the purpose of allowing more efficient implementations in multi-processor systems.</p>
<p>The final thing to be aware of is that an rwlock implementation can choose either reader-preference or writer-preference. When readers and writers are contending for a lock, the preference determines who gets to skip the queue and go first. When there is a lot of reader activity with a reader-preference, then a writer will continually get moved to the end of the line and experience <strong>starvation</strong>, where it never gets to write. I noticed writer starvation on Linux (glibc) when running four threads on a little 1-core virtual machine. Glibc provides the nonportable <code>pthread_rwlockattr_setkind_np()</code> function to specify a preference.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that workers in our password cracker use polling to see whether the solution has been found, and whether they should give up. We’ll examine a more explicit method of cancellation in a later section.</p>
<h4 id="semaphores">Semaphores</h4>
<p>Semaphores keep count of, in the abstract, an amount of resource “units” available. Threads can safely add or remove a unit without causing a data race. When a thread requests a unit but there are none, then the thread will block.</p>
<p>A semaphore is like a mix between a lock and a condition variable. Unlike mutexes, semaphores have no concept of an owner. Any thread may release threads blocked on a semaphore, whereas with a mutex the lock holder must unlock it. Unlike a condition variable, a semaphore operates independently of a predicate.</p>
<p>An example of a problem uniquely suited for semaphores would be to ensure that exactly two threads run at once on a task. You would initialize the semaphore to the value two, and allow a bunch of threads to wait on the semaphore. After two get past, the rest will block. When each thread is done, it posts one unit back to the semaphore, which allows another thread to take its place.</p>
<p>In reality, if you’ve got pthreads, you only <em>need</em> semaphores for asynchronous signal handlers. You <em>can</em> use them in other situations, but this is the only place they are needed. Mutexes aren’t async signal safe. Making them so would be much slower than an implementation that isn’t async signal safe, and would slow down ordinary mutex operation.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of posting a semaphore from a signal handler:</p>

<p>Semaphores aren’t even necessary for proper signal handling. It’s easier to have a thread simply <code>sigwait()</code> than it is to set up an asynchronous handler. In the example below, the main thread waits, but you can spawn a dedicated thread for this in a real application.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="co">/* sigwait_tickler.c */</span>

<p>So don’t feel dependent on semaphores. In fact your system may not have them. The POSIX semaphore API works with pthreads and is present in POSIX.1-2008, but is an optional part of POSIX.1b in earlier versions. Apple, for one, <a href="https://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-kernel/2009/Apr/msg00010.html">decided</a> to punt, so the semaphore functions on macOS are stubbed to return error codes.</p>
<h3 id="cancellation">Cancellation</h3>
<p>Thread cancellation is generally used when you have threads doing long-running tasks and there’s a way for a user to abort through the UI or console. Another common scenario is when multiple threads set off to explore a search space and one finds the answer first.</p>
<p>Our previous reader-writer lock example was the second scenario, where the threads explored a search space. It was an example of do-it-yourself cancellation through polling. However sometimes threads aren’t able to poll, such as when they are blocked on I/O or a lock. Pthreads offers an API to cancel threads even in those situations.</p>
<p>By default a cancelled thread isn’t immediately blown away, because it may have a mutex locked, be holding resources, or have a potentially broken invariant. The canceller wouldn’t know how to repair that invariant without some complicated logic. The thread to be canceled needs to be written to do cleanup and unlock mutexes.</p>
<p>For each thread, cancellation can be enabled or disabled, and if enabled, may be in deferred or asynchronous mode. The default is enabled and deferred, which allows a cancelled thread to survive until the next <strong>cancellation points</strong>, such as waiting on a condition variable or blocking on IO (see <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_09_05_02">full list</a>). In a purely computational section of code you can add your own cancellation points with <code>pthread_testcancel()</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s see how to modify our previous MD5 cracking example using standard pthread cancellation. Three of the functions are the same as before: <code>word_advance()</code>, <code>hex2md5()</code>, and <code>main()</code>. But we now use a condition variable to alert <code>crack()</code> whenever a <code>crack_thread()</code> returns.</p>

<p>Using cancellation is actually a little more flexible than our rwlock implementation in 5dm. If the <code>crack()</code> function is running in its own thread, the whole thing can now be cancelled. The cancellation handler will “pass along” the cancellation to each of the worker threads.</p>
<p>Writing general purpose library code that works with threads requires some care. It should handle deferred cancellation gracefully, including disabling cancellation when appropriate and always using cleanup handlers.</p>
<p>For cleanup handlers, notice the pattern of how we <code>pthread_cleanup_push()</code> the cancellation handler, and later <code>pthread_cleanup_pop()</code> it for regular (non-cancel) cleanup too. Using the same cleanup procedure in all situations makes the code more reliable.</p>
<p>Also notice how the boss thread now cancels workers, rather than the winning worker cancelling the others. You can join a canceled thread, but you can’t cancel an already joined (or detached) thread. If you want to both cancel and join a thread it ought to be done in one place.</p>
<p>Let’s turn out attention to the new worker threads. They are still polling for cancellation, like they polled with the reader-writer locks, but in this case they do it with a new function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="cf">if</span> (iterations++ % <span class="dv">1000</span> == <span class="dv">0</span>)
	pthread_testcancel();</code></pre></div>
<p>Admittedly it adds a little overhead to poll every thousandth loop, both with the rwlock, and with the testcancel. It also adds latency to the time between the cancellation request and the thread quitting, since the loop could run up to 999 times in between. A more efficient but dangerous method is to enable <strong>asynchronous cancellation</strong>, meaning the thread immediately dies when cancelled.</p>
<p>Async cancellation is dangerous because code is seldom async-cancel-safe. Anything that uses locks or works with shared state even slightly can break badly. Async-cancel-safe code can call very few functions, since those functions may not be safe. This includes calling libraries that use something as innocent as <code>malloc()</code>, since stopping malloc part way through could corrupt the heap.</p>
<p>Our <code>crack_thread()</code> function should be async-cancel-safe, at least during its calculation and not when taking locks. The <code>MD5()</code> function from OpenSSL also appears to be safe. Here’s how we can rewrite our function (notice how we disable cancellation before taking a lock):</p>

<p><a href="https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/drd-manual.html">DRD</a> and <a href="https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/hg-manual.html">Helgrind</a> are Valgrind tools for detecting errors in multithreaded C and C++ programs. The tools work for any program that uses the POSIX threading primitives or that uses threading concepts built on top of the POSIX threading primitives.</p>
<p>The tools have overlapping abilities like detecting data races and improper use of the pthreads API. Additionally, Helgrind can detect locking hierarchy violations, and DRD can alert when there is lock contention.</p>
<p>Both tools pinpoint the lines of code where problems arise. For example, we can run DRD on our first crazy bankers program:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="fu">valgrind</span> --tool=drd ./banker</code></pre></div>

<p>While Valgrind DRD can identify highly contended locks, it virtualizes the execution of the program under test, and skews the numbers. Other utilities can use software probes to get this information from a test running at full speed. In BSD land there is the <a href="http://dtrace.org/guide/chp-plockstat.html">plockstat</a> provider for DTrace, and on Linux there is the specially-written <a href="http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/mutrace.html">mutrace</a>.

<h4 id="off-cpu-profiling">Off-CPU profiling</h4>
<p>Typical profilers measure the amount of CPU time spent in each function. However when a thread is blocked by I/O, a lock, or a condition variable, then it isn’t using CPU time. To determine where functions spend the most “wall clock time,” we need to sample the call stack for all threads at intervals, and count how frequently we see each entry. When a thread is off-CPU its call stack stays unchanged.</p>
<p>The <code>pstack</code> program is traditionally the way to get a snapshot of a running program’s stack. It exists on old Unices, and used to be on Linux until Linux made a breaking change. The most portable way to get stack snapshots is using gdb with an awk wrapper, as documented in the <a href="http://poormansprofiler.org">Poor Man’s Profiler</a>.</p>
<p>Remember our early condition variable example that measured how many threads entered the critical section in <code>disburse()</code> at once? We asked whether synchronization on <code>stats_mtx</code> threw off the measurement. With off-CPU profiling we can look for clues.</p>
<p>Here’s a script based on the Poor Man’s Profiler:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">./banker_stats</span> <span class="kw">&amp;</span>
<span class="va">pid=$!</span>

<span class="st">  BEGIN { s = &quot;&quot;; }</span>
<span class="st">  /^Thread/ { print s; s = &quot;&quot;; }</span>
<span class="st">  /^\#/ { if (s != &quot;&quot; ) { s = s &quot;,&quot; $4} else { s = $4 } }</span>
<span class="st">  END { print s }'</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="kw">\</span>

<p>It outputs limited information, but we can see that waiting for locks in <code>disburse()</code> takes the majority of program time, being present in 872 of our samples. By contrast, waiting for the <code>stats_mtx</code> lock in <code>stats_update()</code> doesn’t appear in our sample at all. It must have had very little affect on our parallelism.</p>

<h4 id="macos-instruments">macOS Instruments</h4>
<p>Although Mac’s POSIX thread support is pretty weak, its XCode tooling does include a nice profiler. From the Instruments application, choose the profiling template called “System Trace.” It adds a GUI on top of DTrace to display thread states (among other things). I modified our banker program to use only five threads and recorded its run. The Instruments app visualizes every event that happens, including threads blocking and being interrupted:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://begriffs.com/images/thread-states.png" alt="thread states" />
<p class="caption">thread states</p>
</div>
<p>Within the program you can zoom into the history and hover over events for info.</p>
<h4 id="perf-c2c">perf c2c</h4>
<p>Perf is a Linux tool to measure hardware performance counters during the execution of a program. Joe Mario created a Perf feature called <a href="https://joemario.github.io/blog/2016/09/01/c2c-blog/">c2c</a> which detects <strong>false sharing</strong> of variables between CPUs.</p>
<p>In a NUMA multi-core computer, each CPU has its own set of caches, and all CPUs share main memory. Memory is divided into fixed size blocks (often 64 bytes) called <strong>cache lines</strong>. Any time a CPU reads or writes memory, it must fetch or store the entire cache line surrounding the desired address. If one CPU has already cached a line, and another CPU writes to that area in memory, the system has to perform an expensive operation to make the caches coherent.</p>
<p>When two unrelated variables in a program are stored close enough together in memory to be in the same cache line, it can cause a performance problem in multi-threaded programs. If threads running on separate CPUs access the unrelated variables, it can cause a tug of war between their underlying cache line, which is called false sharing.</p>
<p>For instance, our Game of Life simulator could potentially have false sharing at the edges of each section of board accessed by each thread. To verify this, I attempted to run perf c2c on an Amazon EC2 instance (since I lack a physical computer running Linux), but got an error that memory events are not supported on the virtual machine. I was running kernel 4.19.0 on Intel Xeon Platinum 8124M CPUs, so I assume this was a security restriction from Amazon.</p>
<p>If you are able to run c2c, and detect false sharing in a multi-threaded program, the solution is to align the variables more aggressively. POSIX provides the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/posix_memalign.html">posix_memalign()</a> function to allocate bytes aligned on a desired boundary. In our Life example, we could have used an array of pointers to dynamically allocated rows rather than a contiguous two-dimensional array.</p>
<h4 id="intel-vtune-profiler">Intel VTune Profiler</h4>
<p>The VTune Profiler is available for free (with registration) on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It works on x86 hardware only of course. I haven’t used it, but their <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/vtune/features/multithreaded">marketing page</a> shows some nice pictures. The tool can visually identify the granularity of locks, present a prioritized list of synchronization objects that hurt performance, and visualize lock contention.</p>

<p>People rarely measure things in software engineering, and when they do they rarely hang onto the measurements; this might also be true in many other work disciplines.</p>
<p>When I worked on optimizing compilers, I used to spend time comparing code size and performance.  It surprised me that many others in the field did not, they seemed to think that if they implemented an optimization, things would get better and that was it.  Customers would buy optimizers without knowing how long their programs took to do a task, they seemed to want things to go faster, and they had some money to spend buying stuff to make them feel that things had gotten faster.  I quickly learned to stop asking too many questions, like &#8220;how fast does your code currently run&#8221;, or &#8220;how fast would you like it to run&#8221;.  Sell them something to make them feel better, don&#8217;t spoil things by pointing out that their code might already be fast enough.</p>
<p>In one very embarrassing incident, the potential customer was interested in measuring performance, and my optimizer make their important program go slower!  As best I could tell, the size of the existing code just fitted in memory, and optimizing for performance made it larger; the system started thrashing and went a lot slower.</p>
<p>What question did potential customers ask?  They usually asked whether particular optimizations were implemented (because they had read about them someplace).  Now some of these optimizations were likely to make very little difference to performance, but they were easy to understand and short enough to write articles about.  And, yes.  I always made sure to implement these &#8216;minor&#8217; optimizations purely to keep customers happy (and increase the chances of making a sale).</p>
<p>Now I work on <a href="http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/">evidence-based software engineering</a>, and developers rarely measure things, and when they do they rarely hang onto the measurements.  So many people have said I could have their data, if they had it!</p>
<p>Will the Coronavirus change things?  With everybody working from home, management won&#8217;t be able to walk up to developers and ask what they have been doing.  Perhaps stuff will start getting recorded more often, and some of it might be kept.</p>
<p>A year from now it might be a lot easier to find information about what developers do.  I will let you know next year.</p></div>

<h1>Two Years With Rust</h1>

<p class="meta">I like it. I hope it's going to be big.</p>


<p>It's been just over two years since I started learning Rust. Since then, I've used it heavily at my day job, including work in the <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker">Firecracker</a> code base, and a number of other projects. Rust is a great fit for the systems-level work I've been doing over the last few years: often performance- and density-sensitive, always security-sensitive. I find the type system, object life cycle, and threading model both well-suited to this kind of work and fairly intuitive. Like most people, I still fight with the compiler from time-to-time, but we mostly get on now.</p>

<p>Rust has also mostly replaced Go as my go-to language for writing small performance-sensitive programs, like the numerical simulators I use a lot. Go replaced C in that role for me, and joined R and Python as my day-to-day go-to tools. I've found that I still spend more time writing a Rust program than I do Go, and more than C (except where C is held back by a lack of sane data structures and string handling). I've also found that programs seem more likely to work on their first run, but haven't made any effort to quantify that.</p>

<p>Over my career, I've done for-pay work in C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, Scheme, Basic, Perl, Bash, TLA+, Delphi, Matlab, ARM and x86 assembly, and R (probably forgetting a few). There's likely some of my code in each of those languages still running somewhere. I've also learned a bunch of other languages, because it's something I enjoy doing. Recently, for example, I've been loving playing with <a href="https://frinklang.org/">Frink</a>. I don't tend to be highly opinionated about languages.</p>

<p>However, in some cases I steer colleagues and teams away from particular choices. C and C++, for example, seem to be difficult and expensive to use in a way that avoids dangerous memory-safety bugs, and users need to be willing to invest deeply in their code if these bugs matter to them. It's possible to write great safe C, but the path there requires a challenging blend of tools and humility. Rust isn't a panacea, but is a really nice alternative where they were fairly thin before. I find myself recommending and choosing it more and more often for small command-line programs, high-performance services, and system-level code.</p>

<p><strong>Why I like Rust</strong>
There are a lot of good programming languages in the world. There are even multiple that fit Rust's broad description, and place in the ecosystem. This is a very good place, with real problems to solve. I'm not convinced that Rust is necessarily technically superior to its nearest neighbors, but there are some things it seems to do particularly well.</p>

<p>I like how friendly and helpful the compiler's error messages are. The free book and standard library documentation are all very good. The type system is nice to work with. The built-in tooling (rustup, cargo and friends) are easy and powerful. A standard formatting tool goes a long way to keeping code-bases tidy and bikesheds unpainted. Static linking and cross-compiling are built-in. The smattering of functional idioms seem to add a good amount of power and expressiveness. Features that actively lead to obtuse code (like macros) are discouraged. Out-of-the-box performance is pretty great. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-00-concurrency.html#fearless-concurrency">Fearless Concurrency</a> actually delivers.</p>

<p>There's a lot more, too.</p>

<p><strong>What might make Rust unsuccessful?</strong>
There are also some things I don't particularly like about Rust. Some of those are short-term. Learning how to write async networking code in Rust during the year or so before <em>async</em> and <em>await</em> were stabilized was a frustrating mess of inconsistent documentation and broken APIs. The compiler isn't as smart about optimizations like loop unrolling and autovectorization as C compilers tend to be (even where it does a great job eliding the safety checks, and other Rust-specific overhead). Some parts of the specification, like aliasing rules and the exact definitions of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/enum.Ordering.html">atomic memory orderings</a>, are still a little fuzzier than I would like. Static analysis tooling has a way to go. Allocating aligned memory is tricky, especially if you still want to use some of the standard data structures. And so on.</p>

<p>In each of these cases, and more like them, the situation seems to have improved every time I look at it in detail. The community seems to be making great progress. <em>async</em> and <em>await</em> were particularly big wins.</p>

<p>The biggest long-term issue in my mind is <em>unsafe</em>. Rust makes what seems like a very reasonable decision to allow sections of code to be marked as <em>unsafe</em>, which allows one to color outside the lines of the memory and life cycle guarantees. As the name implies <em>unsafe</em> code tends to be <em>unsafe</em>. The big problem with <em>unsafe</em> code isn't that the code inside the block is unsafe, it's that it can break the safety properties of safe code in subtle and non-obvious ways. Even safe code that's thousands of lines away. This kind of action-at-a-distance can make it difficult to reason about the properties of any code-base that contains <em>unsafe</em> code. For low-level systems code, that's probably all of them.</p>

<p>This isn't a surprise to the community. The Rust community is very realistic about the costs and benefits of <em>unsafe</em>. Sometimes that debate goes too far (as <a href="https://words.steveklabnik.com/a-sad-day-for-rust">Steve Klabnik has written about</a>), but mostly the debate and culture seems healthy to me as a relative outsider.</p>

<p>The problem is that this spooky behavior of <em>unsafe</em> tends not to be obvious to new Rust programmers. The mental model I've seen nearly everybody start with, including myself, is that <em>unsafe</em> blocks can break things inside them and so care needs to be paid to writing that code well. Unfortunately, that's not sufficient.</p>

<p>Better static and dynamic analysis tooling could help here, as well as some better help from the compiler, and alternatives to some uses of <em>unsafe</em>. I suspect that the long-term success of Rust as a systems language is going to depend on how well the community and tools handle <em>unsafe</em>. A lot of the value of Rust lies in its safety, and it's still too easy to break that safety without knowing it.</p>

<p>Another long-term risk is the size of the language. It's been over 10 years since I last worked with C++ every day, and I'm nowhere near being a competent C++ programmer anymore. Part of that is because C++ has evolved, which is a very good thing. Part of it is because C++ is <em>huge</em>. From a decade away, it seems hard to be a competent part-time C++ programmer: you need to be fully immersed, or you'll never fit the whole thing in your head. Rust could go that way too, and it would be a pity.</p></div>

Debugging web applications can be tricky. Accessing your browser&rsquo;s developer console is the easiest way to &ldquo;pop the hood&rdquo; and see what&rsquo;s going on with your application. It&rsquo;s like a secret backdoor that isn&rsquo;t very secret.
Google Chrome Google&rsquo;s browser is one of the most popular out there, and it&rsquo;s easy to access the developer console:
In the upper right hand corner of the browser, click the 3 dots:

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Here are my favorite music discoveries of 2019. Earlier editions are here:&nbsp;<a href="https://j11g.com/2016/01/21/my-music-discoveries-of-2015/">2015</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://j11g.com/2017/01/10/my-music-discoveries-of-2016/">2016,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://j11g.com/2018/01/04/2017-music-disoveries/">2017</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://j11g.com/2018/06/23/my-2018-music-discoveries-first-half/">2018 (part 1)</a> and <a href="https://j11g.com/2019/01/24/my-music-discoveries-of-2018-part-2/">2018 (part 2).</a></p>



<p>You know the drill. A few sentences and a YouTube video. No less than 19 videos. All songs need to be listened to. And all songs I obsessed about at one point or another in 2019. Here we go &#8212; in no particular order.</p>



<p>The first and last video on the list are the same band. I am relatively late to the Fontaines D.C. party. But I am here now! Hands down the best band of 2019 for me. Fresh, cocky, Irish and absolutely terrific. I haven&#8217;t been this excited about a band since the Arctic Monkeys debut.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>This next band probably has the best name of all the bands on the list. The Menzingers. I mean, come on, that&#8217;s a pretty good name! This track is absolutely outstanding in <em>urgency</em>. And I&#8217;m gonna share the single <em>and </em>the acoustic, because they&#8217;re both brilliant in their own way.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>Same song. Different settings. Just great. 10/10 would listen to on repeat.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>This next song is messy and far from a perfect live performance, but I dig the taupe oversized shirts, keyboards and intensity.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>This is an old favorite I rediscovered last year. Few bands can hold the candle to Wovenhand. They are not like any other band. </p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>You know how you sometimes can forget about a song, but when you rediscover it, it&#8217;s like finding a severed finger? This Placebo song is like that. I nearly forgot about this song. Needs to be played at absolutely no less than 11. The SG and piano demand it. </p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>I&#8217;ve posted VTr in a prrrrrevious list before, I really like this bands&#8217; style. <em>Running away doesn&#8217;t feel so bad. </em>You don&#8217;t say. </p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>There are MANY versions of the classic Irish rebel song <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Out,_Ye_Black_and_Tans">Come Out Ye&#8217; Black and Tans</a>, but it so happens that I played this specific version the most.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>S&amp;G were probably my first love, and they will always hold a special place. Their songs are firmly locked in a time and place. Timeless music. <em>I can gather all the news I need on the weather report.</em></p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>SOAK. Soak it in. This song hit me in the teeth. I truly do not understand why she is not a superstar already. Tremendous song.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>The Decemberists, so you know exactly what you&#8217;ll get. Relentless and they will wait for absolutely no one. No time to breathe, go go go go go!</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>I am aware there are only a few women on this list. But Sharon van Ettens&#8217; Glastonbury performance, was maybe the best performance I saw last year. Raw, intense, broody. </p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>Echo and the Bunnymen. In an alternate universe, people talk about Echo and the Bunnymen the way we talk about the Beatles. I am sure of it. </p>



<p><em>Is this how the end begins? </em> Well, who knows.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>This song stopped me in my tracks. Where on earth did this guy come from?  Who is this? Are you kidding me! Fantastic song.  <em>Eres especial para mí</em>. Si. Muy, muy bien.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>Oh, you like synths and heavy basses? Well, are you on the Drab Majesty hype-train yet? No? Well get on board, the train is departing choo choo!</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>The lyrics may be a tad bit <em>too </em>much. But nonetheless: yes, this will work. This will work indeed! One Horse Town.</p>



<p><em>We all stick around, because they tell us to.</em></p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>This is a very special song. It&#8217;s Dutch, but I would like to think it transcends language. Highly underappreciated. Absolutely glorious.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>I tend to skip bands like this. They seem a dime a dozen. But this song really holds up. <em>Really </em> well actually. What are you waiting for Archie?!</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>Let&#8217;s close this list with how we started: Fontaines D.C. Man, this is the stuff. </p>

<span class="date">March 21, 2020 09:07 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>If you’re working on a fully distributed team, partially remote team, or even just working from home occasionally, this is a selection of low-cost equipment you can use to get your home office setup to a “professional” level.</p>
<p>All of this equipment has been tested extensively to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Hangouts</li>
<li>Google Meet</li>
<li>Zoom Video Conferencing</li>
<li>Skype</li>
<li>FaceTime (on OSX)</li>
<li>Alternative browser-based video conference tools, like WhereBy</li>
</ul>
<p>And, all of this equipment has further been tested on every operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mac OS X (including Catalina)</li>
<li>Linux (including Ubuntu 18.04 and beyond)</li>
<li>Windows 10</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the recommendations here also work without special drivers or software.</p>
<p>The main reason for the compatibility is the use of standard USB 2.0 interfaces, which are really the best way to go for the equipment to work well.</p>
<h2>The best remote work webcam: Logitech C925e</h2>
<p>You should always prefer an external webcam &amp; mic combo to your built-in webcam and mic on your laptop or desktop machine.</p>
<p>The Logitech C920+ models are extremely good and reliable on every operating system.</p>
<p>I recommend the <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2N38Jiz">Logitech C925e</a></strong>. This model has a great built-in stereo mic and 720p / 1080p video. It also supports <a href="https://www.logitech.com/assets/45120/logitechh.pdf">hardware acceleration (aka h.264 encoding)</a> on many platforms and with many video conference tools, which reduces the load on your computer’s CPU (and keeps your computer running cooler and using less battery). This particular model also features a simple built-in privacy shutter, excellent monitor mount, and a long USB cable.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2842" src="https://amontalenti.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/logitech-c925e-300x300.png" alt="logitech-c925e" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>If you can’t find the C925e, your best alternative is the <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2MYBKMl">Logitech C920</a></strong>. This is the consumer version of the same hardware — the webcam looks a little different but is also a 720p / 1080p HD cam with built-in mics. It doesn’t have the privacy shutter, however.</p>
<p><span id="more-2810"></span></p>
<hr />
<p><span><strong>NOTE: </strong>As of March 28, 2020, I&#8217;ve been informed that likely due to everyone working from home across the country, Amazon has <em>sold out</em> of most Logitech webcams, including this model. <strong>You might see some Logitech 920/925 webcams on there for $200 or $300. <em>Do not buy those. This is a $100 webcam. If it&#8217;s being sold for those prices, it&#8217;s price gouging due to the shortage. </em></strong>Instead, your best bet is to pick this camera up from a couple of alternative online retailers. I list a couple here:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1370830-REG/logitech_960_001075_c925e_webcam.html/?ap=y&smp=y&lsft=BI%3A514&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6_vzBRCIARIsAOs54z73e8OipoD5IW5y79CYK8Tv1bhV_EWaJ7I6zOcY3c6W4nCPbbFmKDwaAjiSEALw_wcB"><strong>B&amp;H Photos in NYC</strong> &#8211; can ship nationwide, it&#8217;s a great site</a></span></li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.adorama.com/logc925ehd.html"><strong>Adorama NYC</strong> &#8211; can ship nationwide, I ordered from them successfully once</a></span></li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/0X6-04RT-05CZ8?item=9SIAJX7B5A5294"><strong>NewEgg</strong> &#8211; I regularly order from them, they have a good third-party market, too</a></span></li>
</ul>

<h2>The best high-quality speakermic for remote work: Jabra Speak 410</h2>
<p>You may think you don’t need a speakermic for your work-from-home setup — that perhaps this only makes sense for conference rooms and offices. But trust me: this is the secret weapon of every well-equipped home office. This recommended model is very low-cost to boot!</p>
<p>My favorite model here is the tried-and-true <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2KpolLy">JABRA Speak 410 USB conference mic + speaker combo</a></strong>. This should run you $90-$100.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2843" src="https://amontalenti.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jabra-410-300x150.png" alt="jabra-410" width="300" height="150" /></p>
<p>I have three of these in my home office: one connected to my Mac Mini; one connected to my laptop docking station, which happens to have a Lenovo laptop running Ubuntu Linux that I use for programming; and one connected to my Windows 10 Media PC, that I use for Skype and phone calls that I take from the comfort of my couch.</p>
<p>Here’s what makes these conference-room-quality speakermics so great. First, assuming you have a quiet home office space, you can use them without earbuds, headphones, or any wires except for the wire that connects the speakermic to your computer. This also means that when you take video calls, you don&#8217;t have to worry about having that weird &#8220;telemarketer&#8221; look on the call.</p>
<p>The mic quality is excellent. The hardware controls for volume and mute are extremely intuitive. Surrounding the central speaker are touch controls for volume up, volume down, and mute. Your system volume is visualized with a ring of LED lights, and when you hit mute, the entire ring turns red. This is super easy to use during calls and helps when you frequently switch between Zoom, Google Meet, and other conference software, each of which has its own mute and volume controls.</p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s a speakerphone, you don&#8217;t need to worry about echo. Let me repeat that (unironically): you don’t need to worry about echo! This is because the speaker and the mic are coming from the same physical location — so, you get echo-free communication <em>without</em> the need for earbuds or headphones. If you have meetings all day, this will be <em>much</em> more comfortable than wearing pretty much <em>any</em> ear-covering hardware.</p>
<p>What’s more: this Jabra device has a built-in aux port so you can plug in your headphones when you need more privacy. So it pairs nicely with a recommendation I have further down about having a spare pair of wired earbuds available for calls.</p>
<p>Jabra has some other nice models in this series, too, if you have other preferences. If you&#8217;re willing to spend a couple hundred bucks on this problem, they have a premium version of this speakermic that has a nice built-in kickstand, built-in Bluetooth support, and a rechargeable battery (claimed at 15 hours, but many users say the true battery life is closer to 5-10 hours). It also still includes a plain USB 2 cable for direct connection and to charge the battery. This model is called the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bBnLYz"><strong>Jabra Speak 710</strong></a>. Unfortunately, this model is missing the aux port, but if you&#8217;re going all-in on Bluetooth, this might work well with your existing headphones.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have the space for it, Jabra also has a much higher-quality (and much bigger) model of this speakermic called the <a href="https://amzn.to/2xbWX2b"><strong>Jabra Speak 810</strong></a>. This model is nowhere near as portable as the 410, but the larger speaker is more powerful and the mic array has a lot more noise cancellation built in. Plus, it’s separately powered by an AC adapter, and has a built-in aux <em>cable</em> (not just an aux port) that you can use to plug in a phone or other device.</p>
<h2>The best wired earbuds for remote work (and why you need them)</h2>
<p>If you use the Jabra recommendation above as your daily driver for audio on calls, you’ll rarely need to use headphones. However, if you use pretty much <em>any other hardware</em> for your video calls, you’ll want a pair of wired earbuds handy. This is because operating systems and video conference software are simply no good at echo cancellation, so it’s best to fix the issue at the hardware level.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you use your computer’s built-in webcam and mic for a video call. Typically the speakers for your laptop are located near the keyboard, the mic is located near the webcam atop your screen. Depending on a number of environmental factors, calls taken with this setup will introduce a bit of echo. But, you can kill the echo by plugging in some wired earbuds.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you purchase the <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2N38Jiz">Logitech C925e webcam</a></strong> discussed above, it has high-quality stereo mics built in to the webcam itself. But, depending on where your computer’s speakers are positioned relative to the webcam, you’ll get echo without buds if you use the webcam as your mic.</p>
<p>You may be wondering about wireless earbuds. Yes, right now Bluetooth and wireless headphones are all the rage, but note that Bluetooth is finicky with connection issues, and even introduces a perceptible 100ms of audio latency. Old school wired aux headphones work on every operating system, every time, and introduce no connection issues or latency. Since aux ports aren’t standard on every modern laptop, you may need to have an adapter available. However, remember that the Jabra speakermic mentioned above <em>has an aux port built-in</em> that translates the audio over your USB 2 cable. So, that can also help!</p>
<p>If you want to get fancy from a comfort/quality standpoint, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2yHPojO"><strong>Bose Soundsport Wired Earbuds</strong></a> are a good choice, though make sure to get the &#8220;Audio Only&#8221; (no mic) option so that you don&#8217;t have to fiddle with the mic settings and can just use the built-in on your webcam or computer, which tend to be higher quality. There are also a plethora of other options available if the stock on these is low.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><strong>NOTE</strong>: As of March 28, 2020, a couple people wrote me to say that the above Bose Soundsport Wired Earbuds are discontinued and thus very hard to find. In a pinch, I&#8217;d say the best alternative is to just pick up the standard <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-with-35-mm-headphone-plug"><strong>Apple White Wired Aux Earbuds</strong>, which you can find on the Apple Store here</a>. If you don&#8217;t have an aux port on your laptop, USB-C and Lightning adapters are widely available for just a few bucks. Some folks also suggested the <a href="https://amzn.to/39myHrv"><strong>Sennheiser CX 100</strong></a> in-ear earbuds, which also seem like a solid set of aux headphones that come in black or white styles, and Amazon seems to have a stock of those.</span></p>
<hr />
<p>There are a couple of other options to have a “wired backup” to a pair of wireless headphones. These are the <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/33E8ao1">Bose Soundlink On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2WysyFS">Bose 700 Over-Ear Bluetooth Headphones</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Each of these headphones includes a wired aux cable that plugs into the wireless headphones and allows them to work without Bluetooth. This can combine nicely with the Jabra speakermic above. As for deciding between the <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/33E8ao1">on-ear Bose Soundlink</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2WysyFS">over-ear Bose 700</a></strong>, here’s a quick pro/con based on my own personal experience with both:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/33E8ao1">Bose Soundlink On-Ear</a></strong> is a super portable pair of headphones. They “collapse” into a tight bundle that can be tucked away in a drawer or in your backpack. Since they are on-ear models, they also tend to be more comfortable for extended wear. The volume and Bluetooth controls are hardware buttons that are easy-to-use. However, if you <em>are</em> using them for Bluetooth calls (that is, as a mic and as a speaker), the mic quality is not necessarily the best. And the noise cancellation is minimal.</li>
<li>The <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2WysyFS">Bose 700 Over-Ear</a></strong> headphones are less portable, but they are a super-high-quality, both the audio quality and the fit-and-finish. They have a number of features specifically designed to work well with your smartphone — for example, integration with Google Assistant (on Android) or Siri (on iPhone). They also uses the latest Bluetooth standard (5.0) and a rapid Bluetooth pairing speed. If you choose to use these for Bluetooth calls, they have the best noise cancellation sound you can find, and even have an extensive ambient noise cancellation for the stereo mic array.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2844" src="https://amontalenti.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bose-700-225x300.png" alt="bose-700" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>Between these two, I think the <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2WysyFS">Bose 700</a></strong> is the better option in 2020, especially if portability isn’t a concern.</p>
<h2>One more note on Bluetooth devices</h2>
<p>I generally advise all remote workers to avoid Bluetooth devices altogether. If you insist on using them, you should follow these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the headphone or speakermic permanently paired with your computer, as the slow speed of pairing can be really annoying in conference calls.</li>
<li>Make sure your device, your computer, and your operating system are all <em>at least</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Bluetooth_4.0">Bluetooth 4.0 </a> compatible. If your computer isn&#8217;t, buy a cheap USB adapter to add Bluetooth 4.0+ support. If all of your devices aren’t Bluetooth 4.0 compatible, your audio quality on calls will be <em>terrible</em> for the other parties on your call, even though the quality for <em>you</em> might be fine. If you&#8217;ve ever been on calls where the other person sounds really &#8220;tinny&#8221; and their mic quality sounds terrible, it&#8217;s probably because they were using Bluetooth 1.0 &#8211; 3.0 somewhere in their device chain. The <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/33E8ao1">Bose Soundlink On-Ear Headphones</a></strong> I recommend above have Bluetooth 4.0 support.</li>
<li>Ideally, opt for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Bluetooth_5">Bluetooth 5.0 </a> devices. These are newer and have some further improvements. The <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2WysyFS">Bose 700 Over-Ear Headphones</a></strong> I recommend above have Bluetooth 5.0 support.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, given all the issues with Bluetooth — range, connectivity, pairing, different versions of the standard, and software issues on the operating systems themselves — I really recommend you treat these devices as &#8220;backup options&#8221; and go with higher-quality USB 2 devices recommended above as your daily drivers.</p>
<h2>Another tip: if you’re low on ports, use a USB hub or dock</h2>
<p>People who work from home regularly want to avoid the scramble typically involved to plug in all the devices needed for a good video call. A USB hub or dock makes this a snap — reducing the problem to a single cable. Here are some recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2WzNBIa">Anker makes a <strong>slim horizontal 4-port USB 3.0 hub</strong></a> (with backwards compatibility to USB 2.0) that is probably the best choice for most distributed team members.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/39fHsne">Anker also makes an <strong>small upright/vertical 4-port USB 3.0 hub</strong></a> which might be a better fit if you’re using it with a desktop computer or as part of a docking setup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, these are cheap, solid options that you’ll probably need given how many devices you’ll want to plug in at-once via a single cable.</p>
<h2>Some software recommendations</h2>
<p>Once you have all this great hardware, you also need to master the software on your operating system of choice. Here, I have some recommendations for Mac OS X software you can use for a number of common remote working problems. There’s probably equivalent software available for Linux and Windows, too.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adjust your mic settings</strong>: On OS X, you can keep a shortcut to the “Systems Preferences” application on your dock, and you can also use the Volume Control in the top-right of your operating system to quickly switch output devices. You can also use the <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA265/how-do-i-test-my-sound-is-working-in-skype-make-an-echo-test-call">Skype call testing &#8220;echo&#8221; service</a> to easily test your audio settings. Here&#8217;s how the Sound preferences panel looks. Make sure to check off the checkbox at the bottom:</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-2835 aligncenter" src="https://amontalenti.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mic-settings-osx.png" alt="mic-settings-osx" width="671" height="501" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adjust screensharing resolution</strong>: when screensharing, you’ll want to turn down your screen resolution, especially if you have a 4K monitor or retina display. Switching to 720p (e.g. 1366&#215;768) or 1080p (1920&#215;1080) tends to be the best to provide real estate while also making text readable for most screenshare watchers — salespeople, this also applies to when doing webinars or sales calls for prospects and customers! An excellent free app on Mac OS X for this is called <a href="https://bestres.wojtek.im/">BestRes</a>. It lets you switch resolutions in a single click. Here&#8217;s how that looks:</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-2836 aligncenter" src="https://amontalenti.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bestres-osx.png" alt="bestres-osx" width="573" height="298" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn off notifications</strong>: there’s nothing more embarassing than getting a text message on iMessage in the middle of an important work meeting. On OSX, the free app <a href="https://muzzleapp.com/">Muzzle</a> will hide all of your notifications whenever it notices that a Zoom or Google Meet call is running. <strong>This is very important. </strong>If you&#8217;re the kind of person who gets a lot of &#8220;private&#8221; text messages throughout the day, you don&#8217;t want these being streamed over your video conference to your boss and work colleagues! Here&#8217;s a couple of &#8220;embarrassing message&#8221; examples from the Muzzle website:</li>

<li><strong>Toggle your webcam’s video stream</strong>: The Logitech C920 webcams recommended above have two different “streams”, the “Standard Definition” (360p) stream and the “High Definition” (720p or 1080p) stream. Unfortunately this can’t be toggled at an operating system level, you have to check the settings for each individual app to adjust this. But, for the highest quality calls, you’ll want to make sure “High Definition” is selected. You can use “Standard Definition” when bandwidth usage is a concern. Here you can see the way these settings show up in Google Meet. To get to this panel, you need to click the &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; button and then goto &#8220;Settings&#8221;.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final real-world tip: use a simple real-life backdrop</h2>
<p>People tend to get needlessly distracted by what&#8217;s in the background of your video calls. Ideally use a plain white backdrop or tailor your backdrop with things like a neat bookshelf or wall art.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot I took of a recent team call, where I blurred out people and then gave &#8220;report card grades&#8221; to their backgrounds. Note that two of these folks, I had no clue what their <em>actual</em> background was, since one picked a NASA control room as their &#8220;virtual background&#8221; and the other picked the University of Virginia campus!</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-2840 aligncenter" src="https://amontalenti.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/zoom-calls-backgrounds.png" alt="zoom-calls-backgrounds" width="1234" height="521" /></p>
<p>If your room is a mess, pick a nice virtual background! This is only really supported in Zoom via its <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background">Virtual Background feature</a>, but note that it increases the CPU load of calls and requires a computer with a modern GPU.</p>

Many scientific computing applications consist of processing data and then writing out to disk. Often the application will be I/O bound, which means that the computation time is shorter that the time it takes to read or write data to disk.

<h4><a href="https://www.wezm.net/v2/posts/2020/rust-top-alternatives/">Comparing Alternatives to top Written in Rust</a>

<span class="date">March 20, 2020 11:45 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Recently I aliased <code>top</code> to <a href="https://github.com/cjbassi/ytop">ytop</a>. Then I became aware of <a href="https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom">bottom</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/bvaisvil/zenith">zenith</a>. These are all terminal based system monitoring tools that you might
use instead of <code>top</code>. In this post I set out to compare them.</p>

  <a href="https://www.wezm.net/v2/&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wezm.net&#x2F;v2/posts&#x2F;2020&#x2F;rust-top-alternatives&#x2F;ytop-btm-zenith-screenshot.png"><img src="https://www.wezm.net/v2/&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wezm.net&#x2F;v2/posts&#x2F;2020&#x2F;rust-top-alternatives&#x2F;ytop-btm-zenith-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of ytop, bottom, and zenith while building some Rust code" /></a>
  Left to right: ytop, bottom, and zenith.

<span id="continue-reading"></span>
  <div class="emoji text-center">💡</div>
  <strong>Why Rust?</strong>
  <p>The Rust programming language helps people write efficient, reliable software.
I like the language and the tools people are
building with it.</p>
<p>If you're interested in more Rust CLI tools check out my
post: <a href="https://www.wezm.net/technical/2019/10/useful-command-line-tools/">An Illustrated Guide to Some Useful Command Line
Tools</a>.</p>

<p>As the title states all three tools are written in Rust. They show similar
information and are all open source under the MIT license. I tested each one
on: Arch Linux, FreeBSD 12.1, macOS Mojave, and Windows 10. At the time of
testing, all three failed to build on FreeBSD and Windows. Figures below are
from the Arch Linux system, which is a <a href="https://bitcannon.net/page/ryzen9-pc/">12 core AMD Ryzen desktop PC</a>.</p>
<p><code>ytop</code> and <code>bottom</code> use a layout that appears to be inspired by <a href="https://github.com/cjbassi/gotop">gotop</a>. In
fact, <code>ytop</code> is written by the same person as <code>gotop</code>. <code>zenith</code> uses a layout
that's a bit more like traditional <code>top</code> with histograms above the process
list.</p>
<p>I typically use <code>top</code> to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check on overall system load and free memory.</li>
<li>Find specific processes that are using a lot of CPU or memory.</li>
<li>Observe CPU and memory use over time.</li>
<li>Occasionally kill processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I find the <code>zenith</code> layout more information dense, with less space taken up
with graphs. I also like the header row with info and help. The main feature
that it is missing compared to the others is temperatures — but that's in the
list of planned features. <del>There is one issue with <code>zenith</code>: it doesn't show my
ZFS pool. My system has an NVMe system disk and a ZFS pool of 3 SSDs that is
mounted as <code>/home</code>, which is absent in the disk summary. I've raised <a href="https://github.com/bvaisvil/zenith/issues/9">an issue
on GitHub</a>.</del></p>
<p><strong>Update 27 March 2020:</strong> Zenith 0.7.7 now shows ZFS pools.</p>
<p>The individual lines for each CPU in <code>bottom</code> makes the display quite noisy. I
prefer the aggregated line that <code>ytop</code> shows. <code>ytop</code> has a handy <code>-m</code> option
to only show CPU, memory, and process list.</p>
<p>So, after reviewing them all I'm going to start using <code>zenith</code>. It might not
be quite as pretty in screenshots but it's the best for doing this things
I want to do with a <code>top</code> like tool.</p>
<p>Read on for further information about each tool, including an additional
honorable mention, <a href="https://github.com/epilys/bb">bb</a>.</p>

zenith 0.7.5
Benjamin Vaisvil &lt;ben@neuon.com&gt;
Zenith, sort of like top but with histograms.
Up/down arrow keys move around the process table. Return (enter) will focus on a process.
Tab switches the active section. Active sections can be expanded (e) and minimized (m).
Using this you can create the layout you want.

USAGE:
    zenith [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
        --disable-history    Disables history when flag is present

<p><code>bb</code> is closer to regular <code>top</code> than the other tools. It shows a CPU histograms
and a process list.  It has the best process view though, allowing sending all
named signals, filtering the list by name or pid, toggleable tree view and
following a process group. It also has the fewest crate dependencies and
smallest binary. The drawback is the author describes it as, &quot;a &quot;weekend&quot;
side-project made for fun&quot;, and it hasn't seen any updates since Nov 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
<p><code>bb</code> does not have any command line arguments.</p>

<p>Have you been trying to figure out this new world order with regard to work-from-home (WFH), remote work, distributed teams, and the like? I&#8217;ve opened up my calendar for 30-minute chats. You can schedule them with me here:</p>
<p><a href="https://calendly.com/amontalenti/distributed">https://calendly.com/amontalenti/distributed</a></p>
<p>If you want to read up on distributed teams, here are some past posts from my blog and the Parse.ly blog on the subject. Open up these links and skim to get a sense of my past writings.</p>
<p><span id="more-2788"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amontalenti.com/2012/05/14/distributed-teams">Fully Distributed Teams: Are they viable? (May 2012)</a> &#8212; discusses the &#8220;three models&#8221; of distributed teams, and the challenges/gotchas of mixing models.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.parse.ly/post/3203/the-how-and-why-of-parse-lys-fully-distributed-team/">The ‘How’ and ‘Why’ of Parse.ly’s Fully Distributed Team (Feb 2016)</a> &#8212; discusses how Parse.ly approaches its own fully distributed team, from a nuts &amp; bolts standpoint. Our more recent materials are clearer on more modern tools, but the principles are the same.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.parse.ly/post/4736/mission/">Fully Remote, But Here For Each Other (Nov 2016)</a> &#8212; discusses the human element that can be missing from distributed teams, and how you can attempt to layer that human element back in even though you may be &#8220;remote&#8221; from one another.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.parse.ly/post/6386/onboarding/">Parse.ly Onboarding HOWTO (2017)</a> &#8212; a guide on onboarding in a distributed team setup. It’s a bit focused on developers/engineers but could be adapted to anyone.</li>
<li><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/amontalenti/fully-distributed-and-asynchronous-building-eventually-coordinated-teams-that-ship">Fully Distributed &amp; Asynchronous (December 2018)</a> &#8212; a SpeakerDeck slide presentation covering the history of Parse.ly&#8217;s distributed team.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you&#8217;ll find that some of the best advice on distributed teams come from people who have been doing it for years &#8212; rather than from folks that are scrambling to do it, under less-than-ideal circumstances, in the last few weeks. Again, if you need help, you can find me <a href="https://calendly.com/amontalenti/distributed">on my calendar here</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s more important than ever that you lead and inspire your teams in an effective way. Remember: not only are they operating on a fully remote model &#8212; possibly for the first time in their lives &#8212; but, also, there is a wider economic calamity around them. They are looking toward work for a sense of <a href="https://twitter.com/amontalenti/status/1240806389825572865">normalcy and purpose</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">People are looking toward their work life &#8212; assuming job is secure &#8212; for a sense of normalcy &amp; purpose when the wider economic calamity seems senseless &amp; cruel. If you're a leader, be careful not to cause further burnout to your staff. People are burnt out right now by default.</p>

<p></p>
<p>If you can give that normalcy and purpose to them, you can do them a great service. I am glad to help in any way I can to think through the leadership challenges in a distributed setting.</p>
<p>Stay safe out there!</p>
<p><small>Why might I have a good background to chat with you about distributed teams? I&#8217;ve been doing it <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmontalenti">for over ten years</a>. I currently lead the engineering, product, and design team at Parse.ly, which is one of the earliest practitioners of the &#8220;fully distributed&#8221; model among modern software &amp; SaaS companies. It scaled up to millions in revenue and a staff of 50+ amazing contributors. Parse.ly&#8217;s fully distributed team spans across sales, marketing, support, product, engineering, and design. Even prior to my time at Parse.ly, I worked on distributed teams in the open source community and in Fortune 500 firms.

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2020/03/16/lissajous-curves/">Lissajous Curves</a>

<span class="date">March 16, 2020 12:00 AM</span>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I recently watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CbPksEl51Q">this Standup Maths video on Lissajous curves</a> and quickly fell into a wikipedia hole researching the topic. It turns out that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve">Lissajous curves</a> are a set of parametric equations defined in terms of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">a</span></code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">b</span></code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="err">δ</span></code> (delta):</p>

</div>

<p>When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">a</span></code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">b</span></code> are natural numbers and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">a</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nx">b</span></code> is rational, the corresponding Lissajous curve is “closed” and resembles some kind of knot with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">a</span></code> horizontal lobes and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">b</span></code> vertical lobes. This relationship fascinated me, so I wrote a quick React application that renders an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">n</span></code> by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">n</span></code> grid of Lissajous curves to an HTML5 canvas:</p>

<div id="root"></div>

<p>Each cell in the grid represents an intersection of an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">a</span></code> value, plotted on the vertical axis and ranging from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="mi">1</span></code> at the top to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="mi">20</span></code> at the bottom, and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">b</span></code> value, plotted on the horizontal axis and once again ranging from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="mi">1</span></code> on the left to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="mi">20</span></code> on the right.</p>

<p>The complete repository for this project <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/hello_lissajous">can be found on Github</a>. <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/hello_lissajous/blob/master/src/Lissajous.js">The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">Lissajous</span></code> component</a> renders a single Lissajous curve for a given <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">a</span></code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">b</span></code>, while <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/hello_lissajous/blob/master/src/MultiLissajous.js">the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">MultiLissajous</span></code> component</a> efficiently renders the grid of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">n</span></code> Lissajous curves.</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p><a href="http://tagide.com/EPSBook/">Exercises in Programming Style</a> by <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~lopes/">Cristina Lopes</a> is an interesting little book.</p>
<p>The books I have previously read on programming style pick a language, and then write various programs in that language using different styles, idioms, or just following quirky rules, e.g., no explicit loops, must use sets, etc.  &#8220;Algorithms in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNOBOL">Snobol 4</a>&#8221; by James F. Gimpel is a fascinating read, but something of an acquired taste.</p>
<p>EPS does pick a language, Python, but the bulk of the book is really a series of example programs illustrating a language feature/concept that is central to a particular kind of language, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">continuation-passing style</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe architecture</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)">reflection</a>.  All the programs implement the same problem: counting the number of occurrences of each word in a text file (Jane Austin&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a> is used).</p>
<p>The 33 chapters are each about six or seven pages long, and contain a page or two or code.  Everything is very succinct, and does a good job of illustrating one main idea.</p>
<p>While the first example does not ring true, things quickly pick up and there are lots of interesting insights to be had.  The first example is based on limited storage (1,024 bytes), and just does not make efficient use of the available bits (e.g., upper case letters can be represented using 5-bits, leaving three unused bits or 37% of available storage; a developer limited to 1K would not waste such a large amount of storage).</p>
<p>Solving the same problem in each example removes the overhead of having to learn what is essentially housekeeping material.  It also makes it easy to compare the solutions created using different ideas.   The downside is that there is not always a good fit between the idea being illustrated and the problem being solved.</p>
<p>There is one major omission.  Unstructured programming; back in the day it was just called programming, but then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">structured programming</a> came along, and want went before was called unstructured.  Structured programming allowed a conditional statement to apply to multiple statements, an obviously simple idea once somebody tells you.</p>
<p>When an if-statement can only be followed by a single statement, that statement has to be a <code>goto</code>; an <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> is implemented as (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a>, I wrote lots of code like this during my first few years of programming):</p>
<pre lang="fortran">
      IF (I .EQ. J)
      GOTO 100
      Z=1
      GOTO 200
100   Z=2
200
</pre>
<p>Based on the EPS code in chapter 3, Monolithic, an unstructured Python example might look like (if Python supported <code>goto</code>):</p>
<pre lang="python">
for line in open(sys.argv[1]):
    start_char = None
    i = 0
    for c in line:
        if start_char != None:
           goto L0100
        if not c.isalnum():
           goto L0300
        # We found the start of a word
        start_char = i
        goto L0300
        L0100:
        if c.isalnum():
           goto L0300
        # We found the end of a word. Process it
        found = False
        word = line[start_char:i].lower()
        # Ignore stop words
        if word in stop_words:
           goto L0280
        pair_index = 0
        # Let's see if it already exists
        for pair in word_freqs:
            if word != pair[0]:
               goto L0210
            pair[1] += 1
            found = True
            goto L0220
            L0210:
            pair_index += 1
        L0220:
        if found:
           goto L0230
        word_freqs.append([word, 1])
        goto L0300
        L0230:
        if len(word_freqs) = 1:
           goto L0300:
        # We may need to reorder
        for n in reversed(range(pair_index)):
            if word_freqs[pair_index][1] = word_freqs[n][1]:
               goto L0240
            # swap
            word_freqs[n], word_freqs[pair_index] = word_freqs[pair_index], word_freqs[n]
            pair_index = n
            L0240:
        goto L0300
        L0280:
        # Let's reset
        start_char = None
        L0300:
        i += 1
</pre>
<p>If you do feel a yearning for the good ol days, a <a href="https://github.com/snoack/python-goto">goto package</a> is available, enabling developers to write code such as:</p>
<pre lang="python">
from goto import with_goto

@with_goto

    i = start
    result = []

    label .begin
    if i == stop:

I think the most effective way to learn a language is to prioritize learning the day-to-day most frequently used words. Picking words to study in order of frequency is the optimal way to maximally increase your marginal understanding of the language for each successive word you learn.
To that end, I took a dataset of Weibo (China&rsquo;s Twitter) posts and ranked all words that appeared in the dataset order of frequency.</div>

<h4><a href="https://www.gkbrk.com/2020/03/encryption/">Rolling your own encryption</a>

<span class="date">March 15, 2020 12:00 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Encryption is tricky to get right. Because some data and communications might be
very sensitive or even life-critical for people, beginners are often - and quite
rudely- shunned away from playing around with how it works. But if people don’t
learn by making bad ciphers, they will have difficulty understanding why the
good ones are good.</p>

<p>Software is usually one of the most welcoming fields for beginners, but
encryption seems to be the one thing that can’t be experimented with.</p>

<p>Let’s ignore all that and have some fun, after all encryption is the perfect
project for recreational programming. It might end up being very weak or
decently strong; in either case I’ll learn something new after this is done
through constructive criticism.</p>

<p>Here’s a description of my first-ever cipher, hope you have fun breaking it.</p>

<h2 id="meet-xor">Meet XOR</h2>

<p>XOR is the operation that can combine two bitstreams in a way that is
reversible. By applying the same key through XOR, data can be encrypted and
decrypted. Here’s a short example of how it works.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="c1"># Secret data
</span><span class="n">key</span>  <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="c1"># Completely arbitrary
</span>
<span class="c1"># ^ is the Python operator for XOR
</span><span class="n">encrypted</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">^</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)]</span>

<span class="c1"># Decode the encrypted bytes with the same key
</span><span class="n">decrypted</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">encrypted</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">^</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)]</span>

<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">decrypted</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will be a useful building block of our cipher, so let’s turn it into a
function. The function will be able to handle having different amounts of data
and key material as well, in order to support different file sizes.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">xor_vectors</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">v1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">v2</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">min</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">v1</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">v2</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">v1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">^</span> <span class="n">v2</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">size</span><span class="p">)]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you and the person you’re trying to communicate with shared a key that was
the same size as the message you’re trying to send, and you only used that key
once, you could achieve perfect encryption that would be impossible to
decrypt. This is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad">One-time
Pad</a>.</p>

<p>The problem is getting the large amount of keys to them securely. If we can
generate the same random bitstream reliably, we can use it as our XOR key in
order to encrypt and decrypt the file. We will address this in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="hash-chains">Hash chains</h2>

<p>In order to generate a random bitstream, we will use the SHA512 hash
function. This takes any number of bytes, and turns them into a 64 byte
output. By repeatedly feeding the hash output back into the hash function, we
can get a stream of random bytes that can be used to encrypt our file.</p>

<p>This function implements the hashing for us.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">rng_bitstream</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">hashlib</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sha512</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">bytes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">digest</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s a function that will read chunks from STDIN and yield 64-byte chunks of
encrypted data.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">encrypt</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">last</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_entropy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">64</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">last</span>

    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">chunk</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">stdin_chunks</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="n">xored</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">xor_vectors</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">chunk</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">rng_bitstream</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">last</span><span class="p">))</span>
        <span class="n">last</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">xored</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">xored</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we’re encrypting the files, we’re going to make the first 64 bytes
completely random. This is what the line with <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_entropy</code> does. This will make
it so that encrypting the same file with the same password twice will produce
different results. It also covers for any lack of entropy from the file since
the first chunk will always be completely random.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_entropy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">length</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""Read length bytes of randomness from /dev/random."""</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getrandom</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">length</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">GRND_RANDOM</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">os.getrandom</code> basically does the equivalent of</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'/dev/random'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'rb'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">length</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="decrypting-the-chunks">Decrypting the chunks</h2>

<p>Decrypting the chunks is similar, but instead of feeding the XOR’ed chunk to the
hash function, you use the original chunk.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">decrypt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">chunks</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">last</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">next</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">chunks</span><span class="p">)</span>

<h2 id="encrypting-with-a-password">Encrypting with a password</h2>

<p>So far; the cipher we wrote only encrypts our data with a random key prepended
to the file. While that obfuscates the whole file and essentially turns it into
random data, it is still possible to decrypt it easily. We’re basically creating
a secret document with the key written on top of it.</p>

<p>In order to fix this, we will XOR all the chunks again with a hash chain. But
this time instead of using entropy, we will begin the hash chain with a
password.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">passkey_stream</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">stream</span><span class="p">):</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Regardless of the password length, the XOR key starts with 64 bytes. A weak
password is easy to brute force, but the hashing operation at least makes the
data look random. So without brute forcing there is no way to know anything
about the password.</p>

<h4><a href="http://stsievert.com/blog/2020/03/14/covid-19/">Visualization of the COVID-19 infection rates</a>

<span class="date">March 14, 2020 05:00 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>The Wuhan virus/COVID-19 is spreading through the world. The WHO classifies it
as a pandemic (<a href="https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020">source</a>), and the United States has declared a
national emergency because of it (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States">source</a>).</p>

<p>Data on the infection rate is difficult to find. This post will present some
data sources and show some visualizations of the infections. It’ll also
provide some tips on how to avoid coronavirus.</p>

<p><em>This post will be updated frequently (hopefully daily).</em></p>

<!--More-->

<p>First, let’s visualize the fraction of people that are infected in each
country. Where are different countries in the coronavirus infection
cycle?<sup id="fnref:data"><a href="https://stsievert.com/atom.xml#fn:data" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://stsievert.com/assets/2020-covid-19/imgs/coronavirus.svg" width="100%" class="center" /></p>

<p><em>This is frightening on 2020-03-14</em>.<sup id="fnref:share"><a href="https://stsievert.com/atom.xml#fn:share" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Not for me – I’d probably be
asymptomatic if I contracted COVID-19 because I’m young and healthy. My primary
concern is with the load on the US health care system. Case in point: what
happens when grocery stores or FedEx distribution centers can’t be staffed
because workers refuse to work because they’re fearful of getting sick? Food
insecurity and supply chain/economic collapse.</p>

<p>It looks the health care system will be overrun on in early April on
2020-03-14.  Hopefully the infection rate slows before that can
happen.<sup id="fnref:success"><a href="https://stsievert.com/atom.xml#fn:success" class="footnote">3</a></sup> How can we aid the infection
slowing down?</p>

<h2 id="slowing-the-rate-of-infection">Slowing the rate of infection</h2>

<p>Right now (2020-03-14) it seems that the only hope is social distancing. I
think the timeline for a vaccine is too long (<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/who-says-a-coronavirus-vaccine-is-18-months-away">around 18
months</a>), and cures/therapeutic drugs aren’t here yet (though
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/here-are-some-existing-drugs-may-be-repurposed-treat-coronavirus-n1162021">they’re coming</a>). Here are some resources to help with social distancing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/public/php/185/185_factsheet_social_distancing.pdf">CDC fact sheet on social distancing</a></li>
  <li>Forbes “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/03/14/with-covid-19-coronavirus-here-are-10-ways-to-social-distance-yourself/">What Is Social Distancing? Here Are 10 Ways To Keep The Coronavirus
Away</a>”</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, avoid social contact as much as possible. The biggest tips are to
work from home and avoid large crowds. Social distancing is why so many
<a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/28824781/list-sporting-events-canceled-coronavirus">sporting events have been canceled</a> and so many <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/universities-across-the-us-are-canceling-in-person-classes-due-to-coronavirus/ar-BB1105xZ">universities are
canceling class</a>.</p>

<p>The positive effect of immediate and extreme social distancing is best
illustrated with the 1918 flu epidemic/the Spanish flu. The hardest hit city
was Philadelphia. The infection hit the city very suddenly, meaning the health
care system was quickly saturated and overrun. One effect of this: they had to
stack bodies on the sidewalk because the morgues were overflowing
(<a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/st-louis-saw-the-deadly-spanish-flu-epidemic-coming-shutting/article_52e5e46d-1f30-5f31-a706-786785692bb5.html">source</a>).</p>

<p>However, St. Louis practiced immediate and extreme social distancing when the
flu hit the city. Just 2 days after the flu hit the civilian population, Dr.
Max Starkloff quickly ordered the closer of schools, movie theaters, sporting
events and public gatherings.<sup id="fnref:1918img"><a href="https://stsievert.com/atom.xml#fn:1918img" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>This meant the flu spread much more slowly throughout St. Louis than
Philadelphia. Here’s a graph of the death rate for the two cities<sup id="fnref:1918img:1"><a href="https://stsievert.com/atom.xml#fn:1918img" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://stsievert.com/assets/2020-covid-19/static-imgs/st-louis.svg" width="100%" class="center" /></p>

<p><em>Functionally, the time taken to start social distancing is the only difference
between these two curves.</em> St. Louis responded about 14 days quicker than
Philadelphia. That meant St. Louis had half the total death rate of
Philadelphia, and they didn’t have to pile bodies on the streets because their
morgues were too full.</p>

<p>The difference between these two cities is discussed more in these two
articles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“<a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/st-louis-saw-the-deadly-spanish-flu-epidemic-coming-shutting/article_52e5e46d-1f30-5f31-a706-786785692bb5.html">St. Louis saw the deadly 1918 Spanish flu epidemic coming.  Shutting down

</ul>

<h2 id="how-fast-is-the-virus-spreading">How fast is the virus spreading?</h2>

<p>The direct visualization of this is with the number of new cases each day:</p>

<p><img src="https://stsievert.com/assets/2020-covid-19/imgs/new-cases.svg" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>This perhaps isn’t the best visualization; it’s pretty noisy, and there’s no
information about the retired population or the quality/size of the health care
system. Here’s a different visualization:</p>

<p><img src="https://stsievert.com/assets/2020-covid-19/imgs/rate.svg" width="90%" class="center" /></p>

<p>It appears the number of confirmed cases is doubling every 2.4 days before the
infection gets under control<sup id="fnref:china"><a href="https://stsievert.com/atom.xml#fn:china" class="footnote">5</a></sup> (as with South Korea and Italy).  Details
on the back-of-the-envelope calculation are in <a href="https://stsievert.com/atom.xml#appendix">the appendix</a>;
briefly, I take the number of cases required to Italy’s health care system and
scale by the population that’s 65 years or older and number of hospital beds.</p>

<p>This looks to be rather scary for the U.K. The Prime Minister Boris Johnson has
largely kept the UK open.  Schools and universities have been kept open far too
long, and many businesses and citizens didn’t take coronavirus seriously
(<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-herd-immunity-uk-nhs-outbreak-pandemic-government-a9399101.html">source</a>).
For example, on March 12th the government said it didn’t want to “disrupt daily
life before it was absolutely necessary”.<sup id="fnref:uk-mar"><a href="https://stsievert.com/atom.xml#fn:uk-mar" class="footnote">6</a></sup> It looks like the UK will
have more deaths and a higher economic cost.<sup id="fnref:uk-est"><a href="https://stsievert.com/atom.xml#fn:uk-est" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="how-fast-is-the-virus-spreading-in-the-us">How fast is the virus spreading in the US?</h3>

<p>How many infections does the US have? When will the number of people who need
hospitalization overwhelm the number of hospital beds?</p>

<p><img src="https://stsievert.com/assets/2020-covid-19/imgs/us.svg" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>If social distancing does not work and no medicine is developed, it looks like
this virus will overwhelm the health care system sometime in late March.</p>

<p>How fast is the US spreading in each state?</p>

<p><img src="https://stsievert.com/assets/2020-covid-19/imgs/us-states-hist.svg" width="90%" class="center" /></p>

<p>In most states, it appears the number of confirmed coronavirus cases is
growing more slowly on 2020-03-31!</p>

<p>These tests are confounded by testing. On 2020-03-22, it looks like New York is
rapidly expanding testing, or the virus is spreading faster. I believe they’re
expanding testing – they recently opened a drive-thru testing facility
(<a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/03/19/first-nyc-drive-thru-coronavirus-testing-facility-opens-on-staten-island">source</a>), and NY has about 8× the number of cases as WA but
only 1.2× the number of deaths (on 2020-03-22).</p>

<p>I interpret the increase in testing to be finding cases earlier in the
infection cycle and/or discovering the infection in unconcerned populations
(e.g., college students), especially because I doubt the virus can spread
faster than doubling once every 2.4 days. The increased testing is likely
masking the effect I’m concerned about, the load on the health care system.</p>

<p>It appears New York City is a hotspot, and confounded by testing. Regardless if
that’s the case, let’s generate the same plot but without the data from New
York<sup id="fnref:scaling"><a href="https://stsievert.com/atom.xml#fn:scaling" class="footnote">8</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img src="https://stsievert.com/assets/2020-covid-19/imgs/us-wo-ny.svg" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>It looks like the infections in the US are starting to slow down, presuming
that NY is doing more testing. If true, that’s <em>great</em> news! A couple points:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Social distancing is working!</em> The effect we’re seeing is probably from
5–10 days previous, so March 11th–16th on 2020-03-21. That’s right when the
US started social distancing.</li>
  <li>If it continues, social distancing has bought the US <em>at least</em> 4 days,
probably 5 before the health care system saturates. That’s 4× fewer total
cases!</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s study a weak proxy for this question, the number of restaurant
reservations bookings through OpenTable:</p>

<p>The result of this: it looks like the virus is decreasing rapidly!  Kinsa
Health makes smart thermometers, and they’ve done some analysis to see the
level of total infection in the US (not just COVID-19). For a better
description, see “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/health/coronavirus-fever-thermometers.html">Can Smart Thermometers Track the Spread of the
Coronavirus?</a>”.</p>

<p>This blog post is written as a projection for the very initial stages of the
pandemic. The visualizations are geared towards the question “can the US health
care system handle COVID-19?” The following links give some more information on
other aspects, including questions like “how quickly will the pandemic be
over?” and “how many people will the Wuhan virus infect?”</p>

post looks at Iceland (which did some pretty heavy testing) and extrapolates
to the entire world. Main conclusions: the Wuhan virus will infect 96% of the
world and have a 0.06% mortality rate.</li>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>

<h3 id="uks-approach">U.K.’s approach</h3>
<p>On March 12th, the U.K. goverment said that their approach…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>include[d] asking people with even [a] very mild cough and flu symptoms to
stay home, but stopped short of the measures seen in most other European
countries and increasingly in North America, including closing schools and
colleges.</p>

  <p>The government said Thursday [March 12th] that it may have to impose these
more stringent measures at some point in the future, but that doing so now
would be premature, disrupting daily life before it was absolutely necessary,
and risking the public would grow tired of complying with the restrictions
and begin to ignore them just when the peak number of infections might be
expected ….</p>

  <p>—”<a href="https://fortune.com/2020/03/14/coronavirus-uk-cases-herd-immunity-covid-19/">Even while canceling mass gatherings, the U.K. is still aiming for
deliberate ‘herd immunity’</a>”. Fortune, March 14th.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They waited 6 days until March 18th before they “disrupted daily life”. It
looks like they waited too long – 6 days means 5.6× more cases because the
infection doubles every 2.4 days. That’d be bad even if they had a quality
health care system; however, I estimate the U.K.’s health care system can
handle 5× fewer patients than the US health care system.</p>

<h4><a href="https://sulami.github.io/posts/how-to-read-a-book/index.html">How to Read a Book</a>

<span class="date">March 14, 2020 12:00 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>A while ago I read <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567610.How_to_Read_a_Book">How to Read a Book</a></em>, the guide to extracting information from non-fiction books first published in 1940. Like many older books, there are parts of it that haven’t aged well, and in a particularly ironic fashion the book is quite verbose. I thought it might be useful to compile a short and simple step-by-step guide to efficiently reading non-fiction.</p>
<p>Imagine a book as an object with two dimensions: scope and detail. If you read the entire book cover to cover, you will learn about the full scope covered, in the level of detail of the book.<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Well, not really. Performing a single, cover to cover reading usually does not suffice to extract everything from a book.<br />
<br />
</span></span> But many books are several hundred pages long, and active reading demands attention and energy.</p>
<p>You can compromise on either of those dimensions (or both). If you just read the first half of the book, you are compromising on scope, as there is a whole second half of the subject you did not cover at all. If instead you want to compromise on detail, you should read “outside-in”, starting with strategic skimming and delving in deeper afterwards.</p>
<p>Start by getting a vague idea of everything covered in the book, going more and more into detail at each step. At any step you can stop and decide if the next level of details is worth the additional time required, but the knowledge you have extracted at that point is likely more useful than if you had compromised on scope.</p>
<p>The outside-in method is also useful for picking out books to read at a bookstore, as you can just start with the first few steps right there, and buy the book if you want to continue.</p>
<p>Simply follow these steps below, as long as you feel like gaining deeper understanding is worth the additional time. Ideally you want to have a way of taking notes, both to capture sections or topics to investigate further, but also to aid active reading.<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Active reading is one of these barely defined terms, but what I’m trying to express is the notion of thinking about the text as you read it, and actively trying to take in information. I might publish a piece on note-taking in the future.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Read the back cover, and any other summaries and publisher blurbs.</li>
<li>Read the table of contents, note the scope and structure. Identify the important and pivotal chapters.</li>
<li>Read the preface.</li>
<li>Scan the index and references for anything interesting to look at, both inside and outside this book.</li>
<li>Read the opening and closing parts of the pivotal chapters, usually about a page each.</li>
<li>Read the final part of the book containing content, such as a conclusion chapter or section.</li>
<li>Pick a handful of random sections throughout the whole book and read a page or two each.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point you should have spent between 30 minutes and one hour, and have answers to these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the book about, and which scope does it cover?</li>
<li>Are there any additional topics or works to investigate outside of its scope?</li>
<li>Which conclusions or opinions does it offer?</li>
</ul>
<p>The last question is particularly important if you want to continue, as it sets the context of this book in comparison to others covering the same subject. Authors have different backgrounds and biases, which colour their works.<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">A good example is David Allen’s <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a></em>, which does hold some value for everyone, like the notion of the task inbox, but also contains a lot of absurd examples and use-cases which clearly show the kind of life he’s living, and the priorities he has.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>The more thorough levels of reading take a lot more time, but can be useful if you want to get a deeper understanding of the subject. There are two more steps you can take to gain more insight:</p>
<ol>
<li>Continue reading the chapters, actually reading entire chapters now.</li>
<li>Use other works covering the same subject and cross-reference the important points as you come across them. This allows you to get different viewpoints on the individual points.<span><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This is what Adler calls “syntopical” reading, which is a whole discipline on its own. I won’t cover it here, but you can find plenty of material online, and How to Read a Book also has a more detailed explanation.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p>If you get this deep into a subject, the first few steps will be very quick to perform, as you are already familiar with the subject, so you only need to find answers to the questions above before delving in deeper.</p></div>

<h4><a href="https://blog.ovalerio.net/archives/1856">Django Friday Tips: Testing emails</a>

<span class="date">March 13, 2020 12:03 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I haven&#8217;t written one of these supposedly weekly posts with small Django tips for a while, but at least I always post them on Fridays.</p>



<p>This time I gonna address how we can test emails with the tools that Django provides and more precisely how to check the attachments of those emails.</p>



<p>The testing behavior of emails is very well documented (Django&#8217;s documentation is one of the best I&#8217;ve seen) and can be found <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/testing/tools/#email-services">here</a>. </p>



<p>Summing it up, if you want to test some business logic that sends an email, Django replaces the <code>EMAIL_BACKEND</code> setting with a testing backend during the execution of your test suite and makes the outbox available through <code>django.core.mail.outbox</code>. </p>



<p>But what about attachments? Since each item on the testing outbox is an instance of the <code>EmailMessage</code> class, it contains an attribute named &#8220;attachments&#8221; (surprise!) that is list of tuples with all the relevant information:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>("&lt;filename>", "&lt;contents>", "&lt;mime type>")</code></pre>



<p>Here is an example:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># utils.py
from django.core.mail import EmailMessage


def some_function_that_sends_emails():
    msg = EmailMessage(
        subject="Example email",
        body="This is the content of the email",
        from_email="some@email.address",
        to=&#91;"destination@email.address"],
    )
    msg.attach("sometext.txt", "The content of the file", "text/plain")
    msg.send()


# tests.py
from django.test import TestCase
from django.core import mail

from .utils import some_function_that_sends_emails


class ExampleEmailTest(TestCase):
    def test_example_function(self):
        some_function_that_sends_emails()

        self.assertEqual(len(mail.outbox), 1)

        email_message = mail.outbox&#91;0]
        self.assertEqual(email_message.subject, "Example email")
        self.assertEqual(email_message.body, "This is the content of the email")
        self.assertEqual(len(email_message.attachments), 1)

        file_name, content, mimetype = email_message.attachments&#91;0]
        self.assertEqual(file_name, "sometext.txt")
        self.assertEqual(content, "The content of the file")
        self.assertEqual(mimetype, "text/plain")</code></pre>



<p>If you are using <code>pytest-django</code> the same can be achieved with the <code>mailoutbox</code> fixture:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>import pytest

from .utils import some_function_that_sends_emails


def test_example_function(mailoutbox):
    some_function_that_sends_emails()

    assert len(mailoutbox) == 1

    email_message = mailoutbox&#91;0]
    assert email_message.subject == "Example email"
    assert email_message.body == "This is the content of the email"
    assert len(email_message.attachments) == 1

    file_name, content, mimetype = email_message.attachments&#91;0]
    assert file_name == "sometext.txt"
    assert content == "The content of the file"
    assert mimetype == "text/plain"</code></pre>



<p>And this is it for today.</p></div>

<p>I saw this tweet yesterday, and If you know me, you <strong>know</strong> I will not pass on an opportunity for a free book! </p>



<p>But more seriously, I have known <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/">Jason Fried</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">DHH</a> for some time now. From their <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/">blog</a>, their Twitter and multiple different <a href="https://j11g.com/podcasts.txt">podcasts</a>. They have built their <a href="https://basecamp.com/">company</a> around very clear and levelheaded thinking. So I wanted to read this anyway, and not just because it was free.</p>



<h2>Enter COVID-19</h2>



<p>Because of the Corona virus outbreak our 100 person <a href="https://solcon.nl/">company</a> is on the verge of moving from a dedicated office to fully remote. </p>



<p>This Monday. </p>



<p>Yes.</p>



<p>So I am in dire need of some pointers. As a CTO and as rookie remote worker myself. And this book offers advice for both roles. </p>



<img src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-768x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3170" />Remote &#8211; Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson (2013) &#8211; 256 pages



<p>To my surprise most of the ideas in the book were already familiar to me. I had heard them in one form or another in a podcast, blog or tweet. Nonetheless I love that it is all in one place!</p>



<p>The book is one of the <a href="https://books.j11g.com/search.php?id=432">quickest reads ever,</a> and the structure and clear writing have everything to do with that. It is set up as a collection of themes around the topic of remote work. Every theme is 2 or 3 pages long and to the point! The chapters could be blog posts. And each one hammers one concept down. </p>



<p>Most of the value for me was near the end, the chapters about <em>forward motion</em> culture (<em>good times</em>), <em>leveling the playing field</em> and <em>removing roadblocks</em> (those are the chapter names) specifically stood out.</p>



<h2>TLDR</h2>



<p>Key takeaways &#8212; or reminders for myself &#8212; in order as they appear in the book. Some need extra context, but most speak for themselves I assume.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Trust: </strong>of course, this is absolutely key to almost anything. If you don&#8217;t trust your coworkers to do their work remote, then you probably don&#8217;t trust them when they are in the office I assume? And your job is not to babysit, but to manage. <strong>And management starts with trust!</strong></li><li>Most people <strong>want to work</strong> as long as it&#8217;s stimulating and rewarding.</li><li>Culture is the spoken and <strong>unspoken</strong> values and <strong>actions</strong> of a company. Action speaks louder than words. </li><li>Remote work == work. Remote worker == worker. This is an important mindset. There is nothing <em>less</em> about it.</li><li>To instill a sense of company cohesion and to share forward motion <strong>everyone</strong> needs to feel that they&#8217;re in the loop.</li><li>Progress is a joy best shared with a coworker.</li><li><strong>Meetings should be like salt</strong> &#8212; sprinkled carefully to enhance a dish, not poured recklessly over every forkful.</li><li>What a manager needs to establish is a <strong>culture of reasonable expectations.</strong></li><li>Doing great work with great people is one of the most durable sources of happiness we humans can tap into. </li><li>The best ballast you can have is as many folks in your boat as possible with a thoroughly optimistic outlook.</li><li>Equal pay for equal work.</li><li>Great workers exhibit two great qualities: <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/06/05/smart-and-gets-things-done/">Smart and Get Things Done</a>.</li><li>You should read, read and read some more. </li><li>Whatever it is, make it <strong>meaningful</strong>.</li><li>The job of a manager is not to herd cats, but to <strong>lead and verify the work.</strong></li><li>Intrinsic motivation, open communication and meeting occasionally are the factors that make opensource projects successful and they apply just as much to successful remote work.</li><li>The goal is really just to <strong>keep a consistent, open line of communication.</strong></li><li> The real dangers are the small (personal) things, that built up over time. Keep an eye out as for those as a manager (e.g. with one-on-one meetings). </li><li><strong>It&#8217;s <em>overwork</em>, not <em>underwork</em></strong> that is the real enemy in a successful remote-working environment.</li><li><strong>Demarcate the difference between work and play. </strong>So, so important! Keep a separate room, separate computer, separate everything (as much as possible) for work. </li><li>The presence of other people (even if you don&#8217;t know them) can trick your mind into thinking that being productive is the only thing to do. So a coffeeshop might work for you!</li><li><strong><span>The only reliable way to muster motivation is by encouraging people to work on the stuff they like, and care about, with people they like and care about.</span></strong></li></ul>



<h2>Work == Remote work</h2>



<p>Maybe you&#8217;re thinking that a lot of the items on the above list have little to do with remote work per se. Congratulations! You get it! This is sort of the point. There are of course differences, but the <strong>principles stay the same</strong>, it&#8217;s just that the needles moves a bit &#8212; as what to focus on or be mindful of &#8212; when it involves remote work. And this book provides clear and practical pointers for that.</p>



<p>This book is already from 2013, but Jason and DHH were clearly right when they saw remote work as the future of work. It makes a lot of sense. And not just because of a virus outbreak. </p>

I&rsquo;ve been playing around with property-based testing in Racket this past week. I started by forking the existing quickcheck library to try and add support for shrinking, but I quickly realized that I&rsquo;d have to make a number of breaking changes to get it to work the way I wanted so, in the end, I decided to start a new library from scratch.
The library is called rackcheck and you can grab it off of the package server.</div>

<h4><a href="https://danluu.com/corp-eng-blogs/">How (some) good corporate engineering blogs are written</a>

<span class="date">March 11, 2020 12:00 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I've been comparing notes with people who run corporate engineering blogs and one thing that I think is curious is that it's pretty common for my personal blog to get more traffic than the entire corp eng blog for a company with a nine to ten figure valuation and it's not uncommon for my blog to get an order of magnitude more traffic.</p>

<p>I think this is odd because tech companies in that class often have hundreds to thousands of employees. They're overwhelmingly likely to be better equipped to write a compelling blog than I am and companies get a lot more value from having a compelling blog than I do.</p>

<p>With respect to the former, employees of the company will have done more interesting engineering work, have more fun stories, and have more in-depth knowledge than any one person who has a personal blog. On the latter, my blog helps me with job searching and it helps companies hire. But I only need one job, so more exposure, at best, gets me a slightly better job, whereas all but one tech company I've worked for is desperate to hire and loses candidates to other companies all the time. Moreover, I'm not really competing against other candidates when I interview (even if we interview for the same job, if the company likes more than one of us, it will usually just make more jobs). The high-order bit on this blog with respect to job searching is whether or not the process can take significant non-interview feedback or if <a href="http://danluu.com/algorithms-interviews/">I'll fail the interview because they do a conventional interview</a> and the marginal value of an additional post is probably very low with respect to that. On the other hand, companies compete relatively directly when recruiting, so being more compelling relative to another company has value to them; replicating the playbook Cloudflare or Segment has used with their engineering &quot;brands&quot; would be a significant recruiting advantage. The playbook isn't secret: these companies broadcast their output to the world and are generally happy to talk about their blogging process.</p>

<p>Despite the seemingly obvious benefits of having a &quot;good&quot; corp eng blog, most corp eng blogs are full of stuff engineers don't want to read. Vague, high-level fluff about how amazing everything is, content marketing, handwave-y posts about the new hotness (today, that might be using deep learning for inappropriate applications; ten years ago, that might have been using &quot;big data&quot; for inappropriate applications), etc.</p>

<p>To try to understand what companies with good corporate engineering blog have in common, I interviewed folks at three different companies that have compelling corporate engineering blogs (Cloudflare, Heap, and Segment) as well as folks at three different companies that have lame corporate engineering blogs (which I'm not going to name).</p>

<p>At a high level, the compelling engineering blogs had processes that shared the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy approval process, not many approvals necessary</li>
<li>Few or no non-engineering approvals required</li>
<li>Implicit or explicit fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective">SLO</a> on approvals</li>
<li>Approval/editing process mainly makes posts more compelling to engineers</li>
<li>Direct, high-level (co-founder, C-level, or VP-level) support for keeping blog process lightweight</li>
</ul>

<p>The less compelling engineering blogs had processes that shared the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Slow approval process</li>
<li>Many approvals necessary</li>
<li>Significant non-engineering approvals necessary

<ul>
<li>Non-engineering approvals suggest changes authors find frustrating</li>
<li>Back-and-forth can go on for months</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Approval/editing process mainly de-risks posts, removes references to specifics, makes posts vaguer and less interesting to engineers</li>
<li>Effectively no high-level support for blogging

<ul>
<li>Leadership may agree that blogging is good in the abstract, but it's not a high enough priority to take concrete action</li>
<li>Reforming process to make blogging easier very difficult; previous efforts have failed</li>
<li>Changing process to reduce overhead requires all &quot;stakeholders&quot; to sign off (14 in one case)

<ul>
<li>Any single stakeholder can block</li>
<li>No single stakeholder can approve</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stakeholders wary of approving anything that reduces overhead

<ul>
<li>Approving involves taking on perceived risk (what if something bad happens) with no perceived benefit to them</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>One person at a company with a compelling blog noted that a downside of having only one approver and/or one primary approver is that if that person is busy, it can takes weeks to get posts approved. That's fair, that's a downside of having centralized approval. However, when we compare to the alternative processes, at one company, people noted that it's typical for approvals to take three to six months and tail cases can take a year.</p>

<p>While a few weeks can seem like a long time for someone used to a fast moving company, people at slower moving companies would be ecstatic to have an approval process that only takes twice that long.</p>

<p>Here are the processes, as described to me, for the three companies I interviewed (presented in <code>sha512sum</code> order, which is coincidentally ordered by increasing size of company, from a couple hundred employees to nearly one thousand employees):</p>

<h4 id="heap">Heap</h4>

<ul>
<li>Someone has an idea to write a post</li>
<li>Writer (who is an engineer) is paired with a &quot;buddy&quot;, who edits and then approves the post

<ul>
<li>Buddy is an engineer who has a track record of producing reasonable writing</li>
<li>This may take a few rounds, may change thrust of the post</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CTO reads and approves

<ul>
<li>Usually only minor feedback</li>
<li>May make suggestions like &quot;a designer could make this graph look better&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Publish post</li>
</ul>

<p>The first editing phase used to involve posting a draft to a slack channel where &quot;everyone&quot; would comment on the post. This was an unpleasant experience since &quot;everyone&quot; would make comments and a lot of revision would be required. This process was designed to avoid getting &quot;too much&quot; feedback.</p>

<h4 id="segment">Segment</h4>

<ul>
<li>Someone has an idea to write a post

<ul>
<li>Often comes from: internal docs, external talk, shipped project, open source tooling (built by Segment)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Writer (who is an engineer) writes a draft

<ul>
<li>May have a senior eng work with them to write the draft</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Until recently, no one really owned the feedback process

<ul>
<li>Calvin French-Owen (co-founder) and Rick (engineering manager) would usually give most feedback</li>
<li>Maybe also get feedback from manager and eng leadership</li>
<li>Typically, 3rd draft is considered finished</li>
<li>Now, have a full-time editor who owns editing posts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Also socialize among eng team, get get feedback from 15-20 people</li>
<li>PR and legal will take a look, lightweight approval</li>
</ul>

<p>Some changes that have been made include</p>

<ul>
<li>At one point, when trying to establish an &quot;engineering brand&quot;, making in-depth technical posts a top-level priority</li>
<li>had a &quot;blogging retreat&quot;, one week spent on writing a post</li>
<li>added writing and speaking as explicit criteria to be rewarded in performance reviews and career ladders</li>
</ul>

<p>Although there's legal and PR approval, Calvin noted &quot;In general we try to keep it fairly lightweight. I see the bigger problem with blogging being a lack of posts or vague, high level content which isn't interesting rather than revealing too much.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="cloudflare">Cloudflare</h4>

<ul>
<li>Someone has an idea to write a post

<ul>
<li>Internal blogging is part of the culture, some posts come from the internal blog</li>
</ul></li>
<li>John Graham-Cumming (CTO) reads every post, other folks will read and comment

<ul>
<li>John is approver for posts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Matthew Prince (CEO) also generally supportive of blogging</li>
<li>&quot;Very quick&quot; legal approval process, SLO of 1 hour

<ul>
<li>This process is so lightweight that one person didn't really think of it as an approval, another person didn't mention it at all (a third person did mention this step)</li>
<li>Comms generally not involved</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>One thing to note is that this only applies to technical blog posts. Product announcements have a heavier process because they're tied to sales material, press releases, etc.</p>

<p>One thing I find interesting is that Marek interviewed at Cloudflare because of their blog (<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-tour-inside-cloudflares-latest-generation-servers/">this 2013 blog post on their 4th generation servers caught his eye</a>) and he's now both a key engineer for them as well as one of the main sources of compelling Cloudflare blog posts. At this point, the Cloudflare blog has generated at least a few more generations of folks who interviewed because they saw a blog post and now write compelling posts for the blog.</p>

<h3 id="general-comments">General comments</h3>

<p>My opinion is that the natural state of a corp eng blog where people <a href="http://danluu.com/p95-skill/">get a bit of feedback</a> is a pretty interesting blog. There's <a href="https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1043952902157459456">a dearth of real, in-depth, technical writing</a>, which makes any half decent, honest, public writing about technical work interesting.</p>

<p>In order to have a boring blog, the corporation has to actively stop engineers from putting interesting content out there. Unfortunately, it appears that the natural state of large corporations tends towards risk aversion and blocking people from writing, just in case it causes a legal or PR or other problem. Individual contributors (ICs) might have the opinion that it's ridiculous to block engineers from writing low-risk technical posts while, simultaneously, C-level execs and VPs regularly make public comments that turn into PR disasters, but ICs in large companies don't have the authority or don't feel like they have the authority to do something just because it makes sense. And none of the fourteen stakeholders who'd have to sign off on approving a streamlined process care about streamlining the process since that would be good for the company in a way that doesn't really impact them, not when that would mean seemingly taking responsibility for the risk a streamlined process would add, however small. An exec or a senior VP willing to take a risk can take responsibility for the fallout and, if they're interested in engineering recruiting or morale, they may see a reason to do so.</p>

<p>One comment I've often heard from people at more bureaucratic companies is something like &quot;every company our size is like this&quot;, but that's not true. Cloudflare, a $6B company approaching 1k employees is in the same size class as many other companies with a much more onerous blogging process. The corp eng blog situation seems similar to situation on giving real interview feedback. <a href="http://blog.interviewing.io/no-engineer-has-ever-sued-a-company-because-of-constructive-post-interview-feedback-so-why-dont-employers-do-it/">interviewing.io claims that there's significant upside and very little downside to doing so</a>. Some companies actually do give real feedback and the ones that do generally find that it gives them an easy advantage in recruiting with little downside, but the vast majority of companies don't do this and people at those companies will claim that it's impossible to do give feedback since you'll get sued or the company will be &quot;cancelled&quot; even though this generally doesn't happen to companies that give feedback and there are even entire industries where it's common to give interview feedback. It's easy to handwave that some risk exists and very few people have the authority to dismiss vague handwaving about risk when it's coming from multiple orgs.</p>

<p>Although this is a small sample size and it's dangerous to generalize too much from small samples, the idea that you need high-level support to blast through bureaucracy is consistent with what I've seen in other areas where most large companies have a hard time doing something easy that has obvious but diffuse value. While this post happens to be about blogging, I've heard stories that are the same shape on a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that these blogs all have different styles. Personally, I prefer the style of Cloudflare's blog, which has a higher proportion of &quot;deep dive&quot; technical posts, but different people will prefer different styles. There are a lot of styles that can work.</p>

<p>I picked up this book on our honeymoon to Disney World. But I  never read it, because; how do  you read a book full of quotes? The answer is <strong>slowly</strong>!</p>

<p>Of course this is probably a heavily edited and well scrutinized book. Assembled under brand protection of the Disney Company, one of the biggest media companies in the world.</p>



<p>Nonetheless I learned quite a few things, and I have a much clearer understanding of the man who started it all. His choices, beliefs and character are still visible to this day in the fabric of the Disney company. </p>



<p>His ideas about what a park should be, what makes a good story and specifically what the role of entertainment should be. You get a pretty good idea about his thoughts on these matters by reading quotes.</p>

<span class="date">March 10, 2020 12:00 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Imagine you’re implementing a feature to remove all “empty” documents from a MongoDB “events” collection. These documents aren’t completely empty. Each document will always have an array of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">checks</span></code>, and each check will have an array of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">sources</span></code> that satisfied that check.</p>

<p>For example, here are a few documents in our events collection:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">
{
    "checks": [
        {
            "sources": []
        },
        {
            "sources": []
        },
    ]
}
</code></pre>

<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">
{
    "checks": [
        {
            "sources": [
                {
                    "_id": 1
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "sources": []
        },
    ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first document is considered “empty”, because all of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">sources</span></code> arrays nested within each of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">checks</span></code> is empty (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">[]</span></code>). The second document isn’t empty, because the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">sources</span></code> array within the first check isn’t an empty array.</p>

<h2 id="thats-not-how-all-works">That’s Not How All Works!</h2>

<p>That’s the situation I found myself in while working on a recent client project. Skimming (too quickly) through the MongoDB documentation, I decided that the <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/all/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">$all</span></code></a> query operator would be the perfect tool to solve my problem. After all, I was looking for documents where <em>all</em> of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">sources</span></code> arrays were empty.</p>

<p>My first stab at cleaning up these empty event documents looked something like this:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">
await Event.model.deleteMany({
    checks: {
        $all: [
            {
                $elemMatch: {
                    sources: { $eq: [] }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>My plan was to use the <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/all/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">$all</span></code></a> and <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/elemMatch/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">$elemMatch</span></code></a> MongoDB operators together to find and remove any event documents who’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">checks</span></code> sub-documents all contain empty (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span> <span class="nl">$eq</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[]</span> <span class="p">}</span></code>) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">sources</span></code> arrays.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <strong>this is not how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">$all</span></code> works.</strong></p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">$all</span></code> operator matches on any documents who’s sub-documents contain “all” of the elements listed within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">$all</span></code> operator. It <em>does not</em> match on documents where every sub-document matches the described element.</p>

<p>For example, a query like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span> <span class="nl">foo</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nl">$all</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">}</span></code> will match on documents that have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="mi">1</span></code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="mi">2</span></code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="mi">3</span></code> within their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">foo</span></code> array. Their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">foo</span></code> arrays can contain other elements, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="mi">4</span></code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="mi">5</span></code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="mi">6</span></code>, but it must at least contain <em>all</em> of our specified values.</p>

<p>Applying this to our situation, we can see that our query will delete all documents that have at least one empty check, and not documents that have all empty checks.</p>

<p>This means we’re deleting event documents that aren’t empty!</p>

<h2 id="we-dont-even-need-all">We Don’t Even Need All</h2>

<p>Armed with this new knowledge and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">guided by a failing test</a>, I went to work trying to refactor my solution. After much tinkering, I came to the conclusion that the query I’m after can’t be directly expressed using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">$all</span></code> query operator. However, flipping the problem around, I came to a simpler solution that doesn’t make use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">$all</span></code> at all!</p>

<p>Instead of looking for documents where every sub-document in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">checks</span></code> array contains an empty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">sources</span></code> array, let’s look for documents that have a non-empty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">sources</span></code> array in any one of their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">checks</span></code>. The result set we’re looking for is the inverse of this set of documents.</p>

<p>We can express this nice and neatly with MongoDB’s <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/not/index.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">$not</span></code></a> operator:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">
await Event.model.deleteMany({
    checks: {
        $not: {
            $elemMatch: {
                sources: { $ne: [] }
            }
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we’re removing any events who’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">checks</span></code> array does not contain any sub-documents with a non-empty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">sources</span></code> array.</p>

<p>That’s it! With that, we’re able to clean up any truly “empty” events, while preserving any events with non-empty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">sources</span></code>.</p></div>

<p>Here comes another life update.<br />
My biological clock seems to have chosen to remind me to post these
updates once every 6 months, with seasonal changes.</p>

<p>Since the previous post, everything has been hectic. The country I’m
living in, Lebanon, has plunged into an economic, financial, social,
political, and more recently, health crisis. As I’m writing these words,
it has defaulted on its debt payment.<br />
While the focus of these posts is usually not my surroundings, the gravity
of the situation is coloring whatever I’ve been up to recently. Thus,
it’s imperative to start with a summary.</p>

<h3 id="the-past-few-months-in-lebanon">The past few months in Lebanon</h3>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/Beirut_1913.jpg" alt="Beirut 1913" /></p>

<p><em>Language: fire</em><br />
<em>Explanation</em>:</p>

<p>My last post was on the 14th of September 2019, soon after publishing
it a lot of events unfolded.<br />
For already a year, the Lebanese government had been in a dire
economical situation and clumsily tried to argue over which austerity
measures they would implement as a remediation. One culprit was the
currency itself. Having the Lebanese Lira as a pegged currency has
advantages and disadvantages. At this point in time, it was apparent
that keeping the peg was costly, it required the central bank to perform
juggling of financial instruments, buying debts from the governments
with its reserve, that would be paid back from the yearly revenue
of the country. Debts that could be given in both Lebanese pounds
and Eurobonds in US Dollars. However, the price of this maneuver
grew quite a lot. The debt to gdp ratio had become ~150% and debt
servicing made up 25 to 30 percent of the government expenditures (<a href="http://backend.institutdesfinances.gov.lb/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-Citizen-Budget-launching-PPT-english-sept19_compressed.pdf">2019
budget</a>,
<a href="http://www.institutdesfinances.gov.lb/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Budget-flyer-A5-En-2020-web.pdf">2020
budget</a>).
Adding insult to injury, the majority of those debts used
to be bought by <a href="http://erf.org.eg/publications/ive-got-the-power-mapping-connections-between-lebanons-banking-sector-and-the-ruling-class/">local banks owned directly or indirectly by
politicians</a>.<br />
The lack of growth in the economy, which relied heavily on tourism
and a generous diaspora, can’t forever balance the peg. And the
financial moves cover the fact that people are literally paying for
it from their own pockets by giving up on basic public goods and
instead investing in their currency keeping its value. Additionally,
the almost non-existence of an industrial sector, or any export
sectors for that matter, means that all products are imported and
paid for in foreign currency, creating a vicious rampant <a href="http://cas.gov.lb/index.php/economic-statistics-en?layout=edit&id=185">inflation
cycle</a>.
This lead to a rapid increase in the price of living in Lebanon, in
power-distance, and in inequalities the past years.</p>

<p>In sum, there were a lot of talks about new taxes, fees, cutting
wages, increasing the retirement age in the public sector and
a freeze in hiring of government workers, but not a lot of talk
related to the stimulation of the job market other than telling
people to buy local goods and products regardless of their higher
prices. Even though <a href="https://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/country/l/lebanon/LBN.pdf">starting a business in Lebanon is a lot of a
hassle</a>
and could be made easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/vgHBWiHh9YM?t=1819">There has been a lot of sweet talk about this but
rather delayed</a>. Who would want to
give up their current lifestyle, who would bear the burden. Should we
play the blame game?</p>

<p>Consequentially, there were a lot of small protests but the first
milestone, one that put the country on a standstill by having the highways
arteries blocked, was by retired veterans of the security forces that
disagreed and feared a bill that would reduce their retirement pensions
and privileges. There was no actual decision at this point, only rumors,
but the officials made it clear, to appease the crowd, that they wouldn’t
touch retirees pensions.<br />
The security sector is a sensible zone to wander in legislatively. There’s
too much feelings involved as the army is the core of any country. Any
form of disrespect would mean spitting on their service. This is the
old adage from Ancient Rome.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-economy-budget-idUSKCN1S61NS">An article on
reuters</a>
quotes it best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This is our right, our sweat and blood,” former sergeant major Khodr
Noureddine said. “Our salaries can’t even feed us for a day, there’s
no school funding, no good healthcare.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet, the collective memory forgets that this exact
same scenario happened just two years earlier, <a href="https://monthlymagazine.com/article-desc_4506_">in
2017</a>, and that as a
result many civil servants had gotten a raise of ~40%. What a conundrum
for the dwindling budget.</p>

<p>The government was running out of options, options that wouldn’t put in
peril their political future and their personal pockets.</p>

<p>We absolutely have to mention that the Lebanese
army is heavily sponsored, not only by the Lebanese
government where it makes around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures">~15% of the government
expenditure</a>,
but by foreign benefactors such as the
<a href="https://yalibnan.com/2018/05/16/pentagon-oks-90-million-for-lebanese-army/">USA</a>,
Canada, Russia, the Netherlands, the UK, Italy, France, and more, which
give billions in aid, donations, training, and equipment. Actually,
the Lebanese government spends almost nothing on equipment and everything
on personnel.</p>

<p>There was a time, before the civil war, where the military service used to
be obligatory in Lebanon. The army it composed used to be the smallest one
in the Middle East. After the civil war, in 1989, most of the militias
merged their arms together, other than Hezbollah, forming a new army
and officially taking over the country with the sectarian Taif agreement.<br />
As a consequence, some politicians still use the army as their own
militia, or to sway public opinions. They use it as a bargaining tool,
offering jobs to the poorest while making their families pledge allegiance
to the political movement. The army has become a sort of universal basic
income in Lebanon, which means that everyone is related to someone with
a link in the army. The army is engrained in everything.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/israeli-army-fires-lebanon-hezbollah-missile-attack-190901134806880.html">Hezbollah was playing tug of war with
Israel</a>,
as it usually do, showing it doesn’t care for Lebanese issues but more
about its own interests, its brand of resistance™. If there was nothing
to resist against they would have no raison d’être.</p>

<p>While security is extremely important, political elites play the sentiment
card to siphon foreign aids and bribe higher ups.<br />
The entirety of the Lebanese political system works like this, factions
taking care of their turfs, appropriating themselves positions in the
parliaments that are related to projects where they can cook the books,
redirect funds, or take gigantic commissions. Each party has a cartel
of its own, even the non-official ones. It’s a system were hiring is
done on “wasta”, greed, bribe, and nepotism. A system where someone do
you favors so that you are forced to pay them back, mafia-style.<br />
The ongoing internationally funded projects in Lebanon are countless,
but the huge discrepancies between what’s on paper and what’s on the
ground is astonishing. Lebanon receives an insane amount of funding
from: the UN, the EU, the World Bank, the Islamic development bank,
Commonwealth Bank, Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, OPEC
Fund for International Development, Italy, French development agency,
Japan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Germany, USA/USAID, China,
Turkey, Oman, Spain, etc.. Yet, money always seems to be a problem, and
projects almost never get finished. This <a href="https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/exclusive-mogherini-under-fire-over-stink-in-lebanon-from-eu-cash-33136">example from the European union
funds</a>
shows how rotten the public sector is.<br />
Clientelism reigns and companies that don’t accept the status-quo never
get contracts.</p>

<p>There’s no real long term planning, no real urban planning. Why
is that? No organization in Lebanon has the right to sign big
contracts other than the CDR, the Commission for Development and
Reconstruction. A defunct branch of government used after the civil
war that was brought back from its grave by the late Rafik Hariri to
bypass regulation and legislation, to make the projects he wanted
to do quicker. The CDR is under direct supervision from the prime
minister, which was still Saad Hariri until recently. The projects and
their fundings are listed on the cdr.gov.lb site, <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/www.cdr.gov.lb/eng/progress_reports/pr102018/PReng.pdf">here is the 2018
report</a>, and
as you can see, a big share of the funding doesn’t come from Lebanon,
most of the infrastructure in Lebanon was built by foreign entities.</p>

<p>A scandal was reported at the start of October: The PM, Hariri, had given
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/world/middleeast/lebanon-hariri-model.html">$16M to a South African bikini model named Candice Van Der Merwe as a
“gift”</a>
and her government was suing her for not paying taxes on it. And
while the public took it only from the shock value perspective,
what was going on under the table was even more appalling. A nugget
of information that was lost was that Candice is the daughter
of a real estate tycoon and money launderer named Gary Van Der
Merwe, that resides and stores his money in the Seychelles tax
haven. The same Gary that <a href="https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/opinion/opinion-between-your-side-the-other-side-and-the-truth-12846951">appeared 350 times in court for shady
businesses</a>.<br />
What a way to stir up a population fearing economic collapse and already
sick of everything!</p>

<p>Soon after an environmental catastrophe shook the country, one where the
inefficacy of the decision makers was apparent: The forest of Lebanon
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Lebanon_forest_fires">were on fire</a>
and it couldn’t be stopped. Everyone soon learned that the government had
no equipment to deal with the situation other than using their anti-riot
vehicles mounted with water cannons. The firefighter helicopters
weren’t maintained and aid from the neighbors Cyprus, Turkey, Greece,
and Jordan was required.<br />
The population got even more stirred up, sentiments were at their
highest, even though some politicians tried to move the discussion to
their advantage by blaming and using sectarianism.</p>

<p>A week or so after the wildfires, rumors got out that part of the
austerity measures would include new taxes on cigarettes and VoIP
calls. People got the word and went to the streets. What used to
be small protests until that point, soon erupted into humongous
ones.<br />
Disapprovement was on everyone’s tongue.</p>

<p>Folks still wonder to this day what could’ve went into the mind of the
person that proposed the idea, in reality it was a proposal based on
deprecated Lebanese telecommunication laws, old man’s thinking per say. To
understand this decision we have to read the telecom sector history.<br />
It may sound surprising to hear this in 2020, but VoIP is still
technically illegal in Lebanon even though anyone with a computing
device can open an app and call anyone anywhere else on the planet and
only pay for the internet data consumption. The ban is only enforced on
the telecom level to not loose profit from calls, this is why we don’t
have VoIP with LTE.<br />
Back in the days, before 2004-2005, two private companies used to manage
and build the telecom sector, Cellis and Libancell. Each had very long
term contracts with the government with a maximum quota of subscribers
and a specific percentage it would pay the government from its profit
(from 20-40%). Their pricing used to be exorbitant compared to anywhere
else. However, those companies got greedy, they went above the quota
of subscribers and hid their profits. So, the government sued them for
breach of contract and required them to pay a fine. The contract was void,
the issue was settled, and Lebanon had in its hands telecom equipment
but nobody to run them.<br />
A government agency called the TRA, Telecom Regulation Authority, got
created to set the national standards and regulations, set the pricing
of telecom related activities, meanwhile a bidding war got announced
for who would manage the network and at which price. The contract would
work like this: the government would pay for the telecom equipment and
the expansion, the companies winning the bids would manage the network
and get paid a fixed fee on a 3-4 year contract basis, and any profit
from it would go in its entirety to the government. (for more info see
<a href="http://www.databank.com.lb/docs/Lebanon%20Telecoms%20Market%20Overview%202007.pdf">2007</a>
and
<a href="https://www.executive-magazine.com/economics-policy/telecom-reforms-get-jammed-in-the-system">2005</a>)<br />
This is the situation we have today and the reason why someone thought
it was a novel idea to tax VoIP but in reality it was an archaic one.</p>

<p>While the price for mobile related activities has radically changed with
the creation of the TRA, old perceptions are hard to move. The price on
mobile is like a tax that cancels itself to pay back the energy sector
debt. Plus, mobiles are an inherent part of Lebanese society and its
business related activities, especially WhatsApp. Everyone is on their
phones all the time.</p>

<p>Hence, the nation got on the streets and showed its discontentment,
more so than when it did in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_Lebanese_protests">2015-2016 with the YouStink!
movement</a>
that I indirectly hinted at <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/philosophy/2016/04/26/lebanese-mentality.html">in this
post</a>.<br />
It was surprising to see the awakening of a population that had been
trained to stay away from politics, to not have its own opinion and
leave the field for the big players to enjoy. Lebanese have been numbed,
apathetic, and sickened of this from years of civil war, they have
been tortured by fear transmitted through sectarianism propaganda and
tribalism. The majority being completely disconnected from their own
country, acting as if they weren’t living in it, dreaming of fleeing
and always thinking of the worst.<br />
Political discussions in the country are still immature, based solely
on emotions, personal benefits, turf and religious zeal. Moreover, the
social contract is missing, there’s a lack of social responsibilities
when it concerns the country as a whole. In sum, there’s no unity,
everyone has to live in their own bubbles and that means a full on
disrespect of anything that doesn’t profit single individuals.<br />
<em>Impatient opportunistic exploiters</em> has been the way I used to describe
the daily social interactions in Lebanon.</p>

<p>For these reasons, I thought the protests wouldn’t stick but they did,
one after the other, day after day, it erupted on the street. Enormous
groups gathered, dancing and chanting “revolution”, “everyone means
everyone”, wanting the fall of the current political elites, not sparring
anyone. Overall, the protests were non-violent.</p>

<p>That led the PM giving himself an ultimatum to adjust his austerity plan
to please the populace, otherwise he’d resign. Although we all know that
a crowd isn’t a beast that can be appeased with words and reasons. Thus,
the PM Hariri resigned along with his cabinet, leaving the country in
a chaotic state, on the 29th of October 2019.</p>

<p>This event engender yet another slip in the Lebanese bonds, one more
dive for the economy to handle: The lack of a functioning government.</p>

<p>The banks, which had closed on and off since the protests started for
security reasons, instituted restrictions on customers’ accounts. From
now on, no exchange from Lebanese Lira to US Dollar would be allowed,
which used to be the norm as Lebanon has a pegged currency. Additionally,
customers would be rationed their amount of hard cash currency per
week and per month, locally and internationally. The ration went
from $400/week to now $200/week in cash. That had the aftereffect of
causing a slow run on banks and giving rise to many parallel markets
for dollars which the central bank has tried
to thwart but couldn’t because it lacked the reserves to inject money
into the system.<br />
This created an increase in prices in any imported products as
money exchangers were taking a higher conversion rate from LBP to
USD. The country experienced protests from shortages in gas stations,
bakeries, hospitals, etc.. Currently, Lebanese have lost around 40% of
their purchasing power. The biggest loss is on people that don’t deal
internationally, the ones that are paid exclusively in Lebanese Lira,
the people working for the government for instance.</p>

<p>Then a new government was formed, so called politico-technocrat, led
by Hassan Diab as PM, a PhD professor of Engineering at the American
University of Beirut that published over 150 scientific articles and
that previously ran as minister of education from 2011 till 2014.<br />
He was torn apart between having to face both the anger of the street,
the previous political cartel of sectarian civil war veterans, the
elephant in the room, Hezbollah, and a monstrous economical and financial
situation. Not an easy feat to tackle, a political suicide one might say.<br />
His <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_government_of_January_2020">small cabinet of
20</a>,
defunct of Hezbollah opposition parties which boycotted the formation,
had the difficult task to balance public trust, local and international,
along with austerity measures, a crumbling money with a population losing
their livelihood, and the financial sector on a locked down.</p>

<p>Naturally, the anger on the street couldn’t be rationalized
with. Emotions create rise to hatred and blame. The train couldn’t
be stopped. Indirectly, the people made a choice because they had no
trust in the system, a system they were disconnected from. They refused
austerity measures because they didn’t believe they would work. They
felt disrespected, they felt a lack of true leadership.<br />
Lebanese made a choice, a self-imposed reset, whatever the cost.</p>

<p>So on the 9th of March 2020, Lebanon’s first-ever debt default happened.</p>

<p>Amidst all this, the covid-19 cases in the country are increasing day
by day, currently sitting at around 50 cases, the first patients coming
from Iran and Egypt.</p>

<p>And.. The global stock market is in a whirlwind of a mess too.</p>

<p>Is it a

<p>I’ve grown quite fond of the domain of software architecture. So far I’m
on a roll, reading and watching videos every day on the topic.</p>

<p>In total:</p>

<ul>
  <li>335 articles</li>
  <li>95 videos</li>
  <li>10 research papers</li>
  <li>5 books</li>
</ul>

<p>My Anki decks are full of knowledge that I review to not let it spill
out after I’m done with consuming the content.</p>

<p>I’ve attempted Kata programming exercises, which is something anyone
should try once to get out of their routine coding techniques.</p>

<p>I’ve published my first <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/programming/2020/01/09/se-practices.html">blog post related to software engineering
practices</a>.</p>

<p>Eventually, I want to pass the Carnegie Mellon University software
architecture certification program. But, as you’ve probably noticed,
it’s not the best moment to spend money online with all the banking
restrictions.<br />
So instead I’ll continue writing articles whenever I can, sharing
knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s been almost two months since I’ve done my last singing
session. Instead, I’ve learned to juggle, at least with 3 balls.</p>

<p>As far as the brainteaser, Elevate, goes, I’ve used it religiously and
am on a 318 days streak.</p>

<p>Apart from those I’ve been reading on emotional intelligence on <a href="http://emotionalgranularity.com">Emotional
Granurality</a> and been watching ton of
documentaries on Curiosity Stream along with some movies about the 2008
crisis and the Enron company.</p>

<p>On the other side, food wise, I’ve been gifted a fantastic apron for my
birthday and it has reinvigorated my love for cooking.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s noticeable that I’ve developed a huge interest in Urban
planning, management, leadership view, decision making, and been digging
into RFPs, big projects, history, sociology, deals, primarily I’ve been
interested in politics.</p>

<p>I spent a week in Brussels at the beginning of February to attend FOSDEM
and do some sightseeing.</p>

<p>At FOSDEM I’ve finally met face to face with some nice fellows from
nixers.net, namely eyenx, joshua, and pyratebeard. The conference itself
has so many talks that it was a hassle to plan properly which one to
attend. In the end it was a success and I didn’t miss any of my favorite
speakers or topics.</p>

<p>In Belgium I had a blast at the museum of art and history, I’m a big
fan of museums.</p>

<h2 id="now">Now</h2>

<p>I would end with “Which all leads to what’s in store for tomorrow.
More of the same but upgraded.” but today I need a bit of change.</p>

<p>I’ll still put all my efforts on software architecture but I’ll also
try to open new opportunities. Freshness is really needed right now.<br />
Plus whatever I’m already doing but more of it!</p>

<p>This is it!</p>

<p>As usual… If you want something done, no one’s gonna do it for you, use your own hands.<br />
And let’s go for a beer together sometime, or just chill.</p></div>

The bookmark. A small, flimsy piece of paper or plastic wedged into the latest book you&rsquo;re reading (unless you deface your books by dog-earing them&mdash;but hear me out dog-earers: this essay is still for you). Bookmarks are a convenience I&rsquo;m guessing you take for granted and to which you don&rsquo;t give a second thought. In this essay I will attempt to pursuade you to stop using them altogether.
Why?? You ask, would you ever want to eliminate such a simple convenience?</div>

<p><a href="https://www.xkcd.com/1795/">My hobby</a>: opening up <a href="http://danluu.com/mcilroy-unix/">McIlroy’s UNIX philosophy</a> on one monitor while reading manpages on the other.</p>

<p>The first of McIlroy's dicta is often paraphrased as &quot;do one thing and do it well&quot;, which is <a href="http://danluu.com/mcilroy-unix/">shortened from</a> &quot;Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new 'features.'&quot;</p>

<p>McIlroy's example of this dictum is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Surprising to outsiders is the fact that UNIX compilers produce no listings: printing can be done better and more flexibly by a separate program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you open up a manpage for <code>ls</code> on mac, you’ll see that it starts with</p>

<pre><code>ls [-ABCFGHLOPRSTUW@abcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1] [file ...]
</code></pre>

<p>That is, the one-letter flags to <code>ls</code> include every lowercase letter except for <code>{jvyz}</code>, 14 uppercase letters, plus <code>@</code> and <code>1</code>. That’s 22 + 14 + 2 = 38 single-character options alone.</p>

<p>On ubuntu 17, if you read the manpage for coreutils <code>ls</code>, you don’t get a nice summary of options, but you’ll see that <code>ls</code> has 58 options (including <code>--help</code> and <code>--version</code>).</p>

<p>To see if <code>ls</code> is an aberration or if it's normal to have commands that do this much stuff, we can look at some common commands, sorted by frequency of use.</p>

<p>This table has the number of command line options for various commands for v7 Unix (1979), slackware 3.1 (1996), ubuntu 12 (2015), and ubuntu 17 (2017). Cells are darker and blue-er when they have more options (log scale) and are greyed out if no command was found.</p>

<p>We can see that the number of command line options has dramatically increased over time; entries tend to get darker going to the right (more options) and there are no cases where entries get lighter (fewer options). </p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/DougMcIlroy_AncestryOfLinux_DLSLUG">McIlroy has long decried the increase in the number of options, size, and general functionality of commands</a><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:M"><a rel="footnote" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fn:M">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything was small and my heart sinks for Linux when I see the size [inaudible]. The same utilities that used to fit in eight k[ilobytes] are a meg now. And the manual page, which used to really fit on, which used to really be a manual <em>page</em>, is now a small volume with a thousand options... We used to sit around in the UNIX room saying &quot;what can we throw out? Why is there this option?&quot; It's usually, it's often because there's some deficiency in the basic design -- you didn't really hit the right design point. Instead of putting in an option, figure out why, what was forcing you to add that option. This viewpoint, which was imposed partly because there was very small hardware ... has been lost and we're not better off for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ironically, one of the reasons for the rise in the number of command line options is another McIlroy dictum, &quot;Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface&quot; (see <code>ls</code> for one example of this).</p>

<p>If structured data or objects were passed around, formatting could be left to a final formatting pass. But, with plain text, the formatting and the content are intermingled; because formatting can only be done by parsing the content out, it's common for commands to add formatting options for convenience. Alternately, formatting can be done when the user leverages their knowledge of the structure of the data and encodes that knowledge into arguments to <code>cut</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>sed</code>, etc. (also using their knowledge of how those programs handle formatting; it's different for different programs and the user is expected to, for example, <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/132322/261842">know how <code>cut -f4</code> is different from <code>awk '{ print $4 }'</code></a><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:T"><a rel="footnote" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fn:T">2</a></sup>). That's a lot more hassle than passing in one or two arguments to the last command in a sequence and it pushes the complexity from the tool to the user.</p>

<p>People sometimes say that they don't want to support structured data because they'd have to support multiple formats to make a universal tool, but they already have to support multiple formats to make a universal tool. Some standard commands can't read output from other commands because they use different formats, <code>wc -w</code> doesn't handle Unicode correctly, etc. Saying that &quot;text&quot; is a universal format is like saying that &quot;binary&quot; is a universal format.</p>

<p>I've heard people say that there isn't really any alternative to this kind of complexity for command line tools, but people who say that have never really tried the alternative, something like PowerShell. I have plenty of complaints about PowerShell, but passing structured data around and easily being able to operate on structured data without having to hold metadata information in my head so that I can pass the appropriate metadata to the right command line tools at that right places the pipeline isn't among my complaints<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:W"><a rel="footnote" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fn:W">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The sleight of hand that's happening when someone says that we can keep software simple and compatible by making everything handle text is the pretense that text data doesn't have a structure that needs to be parsed<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:C"><a rel="footnote" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fn:C">4</a></sup>. In some cases, we can just think of everything as a single space separated line, or maybe a table with some row and column separators that we specify (<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/132322/261842">with some behavior that isn't consistent across tools, of course</a>). That adds some hassle when it works, and then there are the cases where serializing data to a flat text format adds considerable complexity since the structure of data means that simple flattening requires significant parsing work to re-ingest the data in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>Another reason commands now have more options is that people have added convenience flags for functionality that could have been done by cobbling together a series of commands. These go all the way back to v7 unix, where <code>ls</code> has an option to reverse the sort order (which could have been done by passing the output to something like <code>tac</code> had they written <code>tac</code> instead of adding a special-case reverse option).</p>

<p>Over time, more convenience options have been added. For example, to pick a command that originally has zero options, <code>mv</code> can move <em>and</em> create a backup (three options; two are different ways to specify a backup, one of which takes an argument and the other of which takes zero explicit arguments and reads an implicit argument from the <code>VERSION_CONTROL</code> environment variable; one option allows overriding the default backup suffix). <code>mv</code> now also has options to never overwrite and to only overwrite if the file is newer.</p>

<p><code>mkdir</code> is another program that used to have no options where, excluding security things for SELinux or SMACK as well as help and version options, the added options are convenience flags: setting the permissions of the new directory and making parent directories if they don't exist.</p>

<p>If we look at <code>tail</code>, which originally had one option (<code>-number</code>, telling <code>tail</code> where to start), it's added both formatting and convenience options For formatting, it has <code>-z</code>, which makes the line delimiter <code>null</code> instead of a newline. Some examples of convenience options are <code>-f</code> to print when there are new changes, <code>-s</code> to set the sleep interval between checking for <code>-f</code> changes, <code>--retry</code> to retry if the file isn't accessible.</p>

<p>McIlroy says &quot;we're not better off&quot; for having added all of these options but I'm better off. I've never used some of the options we've discussed and only rarely use others, but that's the beauty of command line options -- unlike with a GUI, adding these options doesn't clutter up the interface. The manpage can get cluttered, but in the age of google and stackoverflow, I suspect many people just search for a solution to what they're trying to do without reading the manpage anyway.</p>

<p>This isn't to say there's no cost to adding options -- more options means more maintenance burden, but that's a cost that maintainers pay to benefit users, which isn't obviously unreasonable considering the ratio of maintainers to users. This is analogous to Gary Bernhardt's comment that it's reasonable to practice a talk fifty times since, if there's a three hundred person audience, the ratio of time spent watching to the talk to time spent practicing will still only be 1:6. In general, this ratio will be even more extreme with commonly used command line tools.</p>

<p>Someone might argue that all these extra options create a burden for users. That's not exactly wrong, but that complexity burden was always going to be there, it's just a question of where the burden was going to lie. If you think of the set of command line tools along with a shell as forming a language, a language where anyone can write a new method and it effectively gets added to the standard library if it becomes popular, where standards are defined by dicta like &quot;write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface&quot;, the language was always going to turn into a write-only incoherent mess when taken as a whole. At least with tools that bundle up more functionality and options than is UNIX-y users can replace a gigantic set of wildly inconsistent tools with a merely large set of tools that, while inconsistent with each other, may have some internal consistency.</p>

<p>McIlroy implies that the problem is that people didn't think hard enough, the old school UNIX mavens would have sat down in the same room and thought longer and harder until they came up with a set of consistent tools that has &quot;unusual simplicity&quot;. But that was never going to scale, the philosophy made the mess we're in inevitable. It's not a matter of not thinking longer or harder; it's a matter of having a philosophy that cannot scale unless you have a relatively small team with a shared cultural understanding, able to to sit down in the same room.</p>

<p>If anyone can write a tool and the main instruction comes from &quot;the unix philosophy&quot;, people will have different opinions about what &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/hillelogram/status/1174714902151421952">simplicity</a>&quot; or &quot;doing one thing&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:P"><a rel="footnote" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fn:P">5</a></sup> means, what the right way to do things is, and inconsistency will bloom, resulting in the kind of complexity you get when dealing with a wildly inconsistent language, like PHP. People make fun of PHP and javascript for having all sorts of warts and weird inconsistencies, but as a language and a standard library, any commonly used shell plus the collection of widely used *nix tools taken together is much worse and contains much more accidental complexity due to inconsistency even within a single Linux distro and there's no other way it could have turned out. If you compare across Linux distros, BSDs, Solaris, AIX, etc.,  the amount of accidental complexity that users have to hold in their heads when switching systems dwarfs PHP or javascript's incoherence. The most widely mocked programming languages are paragons of great design by comparison.</p>

<p>To be clear, I'm not saying that I or anyone else could have done better with the knowledge available in the 70s in terms of making a system that was practically useful at the time that would be elegant today. It's easy to look back and find issues with the benefit of hindsight. What I disagree with are comments from Unix mavens speaking today; comments like McIlroy's, which imply that we just forgot or don't understand the value of simplicity, or <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/885214004649615360">Ken Thompson saying that C is as safe a language as any and if we don't want bugs we should just write bug-free code</a>. These kinds of comments imply that there's not much to learn from hindsight; in the 70s, we were building systems as effectively as anyone can today; five decades of collective experience, tens of millions of person-years, have taught us nothing; if we just go back to building systems like the original Unix mavens did, all will be well. I respectfully disagree.</p>

<h3 id="appendix-memory">Appendix: memory</h3>

<p>Although addressing McIlroy's complaints about binary size bloat is a bit out of scope for this, I will note that, in 2017, I bought a Chromebook that had 16GB of RAM for $300. A 1 meg binary might have been a serious problem in 1979, when a standard Apple II had 4KB. An Apple II cost $1298 in 1979 dollars, or $4612 in 2020 dollars. You can get a low end Chromebook that costs less than 1/15th as much which has four million times more memory. Complaining that memory usage grew by a factor of one thousand when a (portable!) machine that's more than an order of magnitude cheaper has four million times more memory seems a bit ridiculous.</p>

<p>I prefer slimmer software, which is why I optimized my home page down to two packets (it would be a single packet if my CDN served high-level brotli), but that's purely an aesthetic preference, something I do for fun. The bottleneck for command line tools isn't memory usage and spending time optimizing the memory footprint of a tool that takes one meg is like getting a homepage down to a single packet. Perhaps a fun hobby, but not something that anyone should prescribe.</p>

<h3 id="methodology-for-table">Methodology for table</h3>

<p>Command frequencies were sourced from public command history files on github, not necessarily representative of your personal usage. Only &quot;simple&quot; commands were kept, which ruled out things like curl, git, gcc (which has &gt; 1000 options), and wget. What's considered simple is arbitrary. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_builtin">Shell builtins</a>, like <code>cd</code> weren't included.</p>

<p>Repeated options aren't counted as separate options. For example, <code>git blame -C</code>, <code>git blame -C -C</code>, and <code>git blame -C -C -C</code> have different behavior, but these would all be counted as a single argument even though <code>-C -C</code> is effectively a different argument from <code>-C</code>.</p>

<p>The table counts sub-options as a single option. For example, <code>ls</code> has the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>--format=WORD
across -x, commas -m,  horizontal  -x,  long  -l,  single-column  -1,  verbose  -l, vertical -C</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though there are seven format options, this is considered to be only one option.</p>

<p>Options that are explicitly listed as not doing anything are still counted as options, e.g., <code>ls -g</code>, which reads <code>Ignored; for Unix compatibility.</code> is counted as an option.</p>

<p>Multiple versions of the same option are also considered to be one option. For example, with <code>ls</code>, <code>-A</code> and <code>--almost-all</code> are counted as a single option.</p>

<p>In cases where the manpage says an option is supposed to exist, but doesn't, the option isn't counted. For example, the v7 <code>mv</code> manpage says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BUGS</p>

<p>If file1 and file2 lie on different file systems, mv must copy the file and delete the original.  In this case the owner name becomes that of the copying process and any linking relationship with other files is lost.</p>

<p>Mv should take <strong>-f</strong> flag, like rm, to suppress the question if the target exists and is not writable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>-f</code> isn't counted as a flag in the table because the option doesn't actually exist.</p>

<p>The latest year in the table is 2017 because I wrote the first draft for this post in 2017 and didn't get around to cleaning it up until 2020.</p>

<p>If you're running this under zsh, you'll need to prefix it with `command' to use the system executable: zsh's builtin printf doesn't support printing octal escape codes for normally printable characters, and you may have to assign the output to a variable and explicitly word-split it.</p>

<p>This is all POSIX as far as I know, except for the sort.</p>

<p>Another way to look at this is through the lens of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law">Conway's law</a>. If we have a set of command line tools that are built by different people, often not organizationally connected, the tools are going to be wildly inconsistent unless someone can define a standard and get people to adopt it. This actually works relatively well on Windows, and not just in PowerShell.</p>

<p>A common complaint about Microsoft is that they've created massive API churn, often for non-technical organizational reasons (e.g., a Sinofsky power play, like the one described in the replies to the now-deleted Tweet at <a href="https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/733654590034300929">https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/733654590034300929</a>). It's true. Even so, from the standpoint of a naive user, off-the-shelf Windows software is generally a lot better at passing non-textual data around than *nix. One thing this falls out of is Windows's embracing of non-textual data, which goes back at least to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model">COM</a> in 1999 (and arguably OLE and DDE, released in 1990 and 1987, respectively).</p>

<p>For example, if you copy from Foo, which supports binary formats <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, into Bar, which supports formats <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> and you then copy from Bar into Baz, which supports <code>C</code> and <code>D</code>, this will work even though Foo and Baz have no commonly supported formats. </p>

<p>When you cut/copy something, the application basically &quot;tells&quot; the clipboard what formats it could provide data in. When you paste into the application, the destination application can request the data in any of the formats in which it's available. If the data is already in the clipboard, &quot;Windows&quot; provides it. If it isn't, Windows gets the data from the source application and then gives to the destination application and a copy is saved for some length of time in Windows. If you &quot;cut&quot; from Excel it will tell &quot;you&quot; that it has the data available in many tens of formats. This kind of system is pretty good for compatibility, although it definitely isn't simple or minimal.</p>

<p>In addition to nicely supporting many different formats and doing so for long enough that a lot of software plays nicely with this, Windows also generally has nicer clipboard support out of the box.</p>

<p>Let's say you copy and then paste a small amount of text. Most of the time, this will work like you'd expect on both Windows and Linux. But now let's say you copy some text, close the program you copied from, and then paste it. A mental model that a lot of people have is that when they copy, the data is stored in the clipboard, not in the program being copied from. On Windows, software is typically written to conform to this expectation (although, technically, users of the clipboard API don't have to do this). This is less common on Linux with X, where the correct mental model for most software is that copying stores a pointer to the data, which is still owned by the program the data was copied from, which means that paste won't work if the program is closed. When I've (informally) surveyed programmers, they're usually surprised by this if they haven't actually done copy+paste related work for an application. When I've surveyed non-programmers, they tend to find the behavior to be confusing as well as surprising.</p>

<p>The downside of having the OS effectively own the contents of the clipboard is that it's expensive to copy large amounts of data. Let's say you copy a really large amount of text, many gigabytes, or some complex object and then never paste it. You don't really want to copy that data from your program into the OS so that it can be available. Windows also handles this reasonably: applications can <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rdpeclip/fa309d1b-8034-44bf-b927-adfc753e69c1">provide data only on request</a> when that's deemed advantageous. In the case mentioned above, when someone closes the program, the program can decide whether or not it should push that data into the clipboard or discard it. In that circumstance, a lot of software (e.g., Excel) will prompt to &quot;keep&quot; the data in the clipboard or discard it, which is pretty reasonable.</p>

<p>It's not impossible to support some of this on Linux. For example, <a href="https://freedesktop.org/wiki/ClipboardManager/">the ClipboardManager spec</a> describes a persistence mechanism and GNOME applications generally kind of sort of support it (although <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=510204#c8">there are some bugs</a>) but the situation on *nix is really different from the more pervasive support Windows applications tend to have for nice clipboard behavior.</p>
 <a class="footnote-return" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fnref:W"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>

<li id="fn:C"><p>Another example of this are tools that are available on top of modern compilers. If we go back and look at McIlroy's canonical example, how proper UNIX compilers are so specialized that listings are a separate tool, we can see that this has changed even if there's still a separate tool you can use for listings. Some commonly used Linux compilers have literally thousands of options and do many things. For example, one of the many things <code>clang</code> now does is static analysis. As of this writing, <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/analyzer/checkers.html#default-checkers">there are 79 normal static analysis checks and 44 experimental checks</a>. If these were separate commands (perhaps individual commands or perhaps a <code>static_analysis</code> command, they'd still rely on the same underlying compiler infrastructure and impose the same maintenance burden -- it's not really reasonable to have these static analysis tools operate on plain text and reimplement the entire compiler toolchain necessary to get the point where they can do static analysis. They could be separate commands instead of bundled into <code>clang</code>, but they'd still take a dependency on the same machinery that's used for the compiler and either impose a maintenance and complexity burden on the compiler (which has to support non-breaking interfaces for the tools built on top) or they'd break all the time.</p>

<p>Just make everything text so that it's simple makes for a nice soundbite, but in reality the textual representation of the data is often not what you want if you want to do actually useful work.</p>

<p>And on clang in particular, whether you make it a monolithic command or thousands of smaller commands, clang simply does more than any compiler that existed in 1979 or even all compilers that existed in 1979 combined. It's easy to say that things were simpler in 1979 and that us modern programmers have lost our way. It's harder to actually propose a design that's actually much simpler and could really get adopted. It's impossible that such a design could maintain all of the existing functionality and configurability and be as simple as something from 1979.</p>
 <a class="footnote-return" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fnref:C"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:P">Since its inception, curl has gone from supporting 3 protocols to 40. Does that mean it does 40 things and it would be more &quot;UNIX-y&quot; to split it up into 40 separate commands? Depends on who you ask. If each protocol were its own command, created and maintained by a different person, we'd be in the same situation we are with other commands. Inconsistent command line options, inconsistent output formats despite it all being text streams, etc. Would that be closer to the simplicity McIlroy advocates for? Depends on who you ask.

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>The Source code chapter of my evidence-based software engineering book has been reworked (<a href="http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR">draft pdf</a>).</p>
<p>When writing the <a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2018/07/31/source-code-chapter-added-to-evidence-based-software-engineering-using-r/">first version of this chapter</a>, I was not certain whether source code was a topic warranting a chapter to itself, in an evidence-based software engineering book.  Now I am certain.  Source code is the primary product delivery, for a software system, and it is takes up much of the available cognitive effort.</p>
<p>What are the desirable characteristics that source code should have, to minimise production costs per unit of functionality?  This is what an evidence-based chapter on source code is all about.</p>
<p>The release of this chapter completes my second pass over the material.  Readers will notice the text still contains <code>...</code> and <code>?</code>&#8216;s.  The third pass will either delete these, or say something interesting (I suspect mostly the former, because of lack of data).</p>
<p>Talking of data, February has been a bumper month for data (apologies if you responded to my email asking for data, and it has not appeared in this release; a higher than average number of people have replied with data).</p>
<p>The plan is to spend a few months getting a beta release ready.  Have the beta release run over the summer, with the book in the shops for Christmas.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking at getting a few hundred printed, for those wanting paper.</p>
<p>The only publisher that did not mind me making the pdf freely available was MIT Press.  Unfortunately one of the reviewers was foaming at the mouth about the things I had to say about software engineering researcher (it did not help that I had written a blog post containing a less than glowing commentary on academic researchers, the week of the review {mid-2017}); the second reviewer was mildly against, and the third recommended it.</p>
<p>If any readers knows the editors at MIT Press, do suggest they have another look at the book.  I would rather a real publisher make paper available.</p>
<p>Next, getting the &#8216;statistics for software engineers&#8217; second half of the book ready for a beta release.</p></div>

<p>Well, I definitely wasn&#8217;t expecting such sentences in this collection of anecdotes from famous popular physicist Feynman. But I can safely say, it certainly is in line with the rest of the book!</p>



<img src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SurelyFeynman-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3139" />Surely You&#8217;re Joking, Mr. Feynman! &#8211; Ralph Leighton and Richard Feynman (1985) &#8211; 368 pages



<p>Richard Feyman, the eccentric Nobel laureate physicist lived a remarkable life. And he liked to tell stories. This combination makes this collection of  stories in this book widely appealing and entertaining. There is surprisingly very little mention of hardcore science, and absolutely no mention of his most <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1965/summary/">famous and arguably important finding</a>. It is though, about <em>everything</em> else. </p>



<p>So you can expect stories about stories about: picking locks, building the A-bomb, cracking codes, painting, playing the bongos, teaching in South America, learning languages and &#8212; to my surprise &#8212; unabashedly chasing girls, and visiting topless bars and Las Vegas. Feynman was not your typical scientist.</p>



<p>However what shines through in all these stories are two things: Feyman&#8217;s almost unmatched <strong>curiosity </strong>in almost anything (except the social studies) and his relentless pursuit for applying <strong>critical &#8212; scientific &#8212; thinking </strong>in everything (go to the source, can you explain it in an example?). The combination of these factors make Feyman an extraordinary and relentless <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOoJh6oYAXE">teacher</a>. He wants to understand and greatly feels the need to explain things. </p>



<p>The book is a lot of fun and surprising on some level (I won&#8217;t spoil the fun). Even though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!#The_%22You_Just_Ask_Them?%22_chapter">some parts</a> make your eyebrows raise. </p>



<p>Though he passed away in 1988, Youtube is filled with videos of Feyman explaining things and they are a pure delight. Here he is explaining fire:</p>

<h4><a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2020/02/23/the-wisdom-of-the-ancients/">The wisdom of the ancients</a>

<span class="date">February 23, 2020 08:51 PM</span>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>The software engineering ancients are people like <a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2011/08/18/halsteads-metrics-and-flat-earthers-are-still-with-us/">Halstead</a> and <a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2018/03/27/mccabes-cyclomatic-complexity-and-accounting-fraud/">McCabe</a>, along with less well known ancients (because they don&#8217;t name anything after them) such as <a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2016/05/19/cocomo-how-not-to-fit-a-model-to-data/">Boehm</a> for cost estimation, <a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2019/06/16/lehman-laws-of-software-evolution/">Lehman</a> for software evolution, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">Brooks</a> because of a book; these ancients date from before 1980.</p>
<p>Why is the wisdom of these ancients still venerated (i.e., people treat them as being true), despite the evidence that they are very inaccurate (apart from Brooks)?</p>
<p>People hate a belief vacuum, they want to believe things.</p>
<p>The correlation between Halstead&#8217;s and McCabe&#8217;s metrics, and various software characteristics is no better than counting lines of code, but using a fancy formula feels more sophisticated and everybody else uses them, and we don&#8217;t have anything more accurate.</p>
<p>That last point is the killer, in many (most?) cases we don&#8217;t have any metrics that perform better than counting lines of code (other than taking the log of the number of lines of code).</p>
<p>Something similar happened in astronomy.  Placing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model">Earth at the center of the solar system</a> results in inaccurate predictions of where the planets are going to be in the sky; adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle">epicycles</a> to the model helps to reduce the error.  Until Newton came along with a model that produced very accurate results, people stuck with what they knew.</p>
<p>The continued visibility of <a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2016/05/19/cocomo-how-not-to-fit-a-model-to-data/">COCOMO</a> is a good example of how academic advertising (i.e., publishing papers) can keep an idea alive.  Despite being more sophisticated, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putnam_model">Putnam model</a> is not nearly as well known; Putnam formed a consulting company to promote this model, and so advertised to a different market.</p>
<p>Both COCOMO and Putnam have lines of code as an integral component of their models, and there is <a href="https://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2017/10/02/expected-variability-in-a-programs-sloc/">huge variability in the number of lines written by different people</a> to implement the same functionality.</p>
<p>People tend not to talk about Lehman&#8217;s quantitative work on software evolution (tiny data set, and the fitted equation is very different from what is seen today).  However, Lehman stated enough laws, and changed them often enough, that it&#8217;s possible to find something in there that relates to today&#8217;s view of software evolution.</p>
<p>Brooks&#8217; book &#8220;The Mythical Man-Month&#8221; deals with project progress and manpower; what he says is timeless.  The problem is that while lots of people seem happy to cite him, very few people seem to have read the book (which is a shame).</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/">book coming out this year</a> that provides lots of evidence that the ancient wisdom is wrong or at best harmless, but it does not contain more accurate models to replace what currently exists <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" /></p></div>

It&rsquo;s time we stopped fearing, complaining, and arguing about whiteboard coding interviews.
With a solid plan, a little skilling up, and some practice, you can master the whiteboard interview. We can argue for days about the validity of this type of interview, but the fact is many organizations require it. So are you going to let this obstacle stop you from getting the job you want?

<h4><a href="https://j11g.com/2020/02/21/infinite-jest-david-foster-wallace/">Infinite Jest – David Foster Wallace</a>

<span class="date">February 21, 2020 03:38 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Today is February 21st, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a>&#8216;s birthday.  So it&#8217;s rather fitting that today I <strong>finished reading</strong> his magnum opus: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest">Infinite Jest</a>. The notoriously long and difficult book from 1996 with visionary insights on modern life. Infinite Jest is one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest_novels">biggest books</a> ever written, and it certainly is the biggest book I have ever read.</p>



<p>It took me somewhere between 50 and 60 hours over the course of four months and I &#8212; had to &#8212; read several other books in between to <em>cool off</em>. So, it was quite the experience. I will try to write some of those <strong>personal </strong>experiences and observations down here. This post will <strong>not</strong> discuss or try to dissect the work and themes itself. Many, many, many books and articles have already tried to do that.</p>



<p>No <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/35mgfj/reading_infinite_jest_without_reading_the/cr5rmkd/">footnotes</a>, I promise.</p>



<h2>Why did I read it?</h2>



<p>I knew about Wallace and his challenging writing style, and he always looked intimidating. But last year I picked up &#8216;<a href="https://j11g.com/2019/08/08/a-supposedly-fun-thing-ill-never-do-again-david-foster-wallace/">A Supposedly Fun Thing I&#8217;ll Never Do Again&#8217;</a> and it was one of the greatest and funniest things I have ever read (specifically the title essay). <a href="https://twitter.com/loginn/status/1157218204386770944">And while I was reading that book I tracked down a copy of Infinite Jest</a>. I clearly remember my hesitation. It looked <strong>terrifyingly dense.</strong> Over 1100 pages in the smallest possible font and hardly any line breaks. And this was just the typesetting, let alone the content! But I bought it anyway, with no real plan to actually read it, yet&#8230; But in October I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_the_Tour">&#8216;The End of the Tour&#8217;</a> &#8212; which I greatly enjoyed &#8212; so I just had to know what this was all about.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Montpellier-InfiniteJest-576x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3125" width="288" height="512" />There it was. Fresh.</div>



<h2>Did I enjoy it?</h2>



<p>Infinite Jest is not your typical <em>enjoyable</em> reader-friendly book. It is also definitely not a funny book. And it certainly wasn&#8217;t intended to be. There are multiple horrific scenes of rape, incest, mutilation and drug abuse (and their consequences i.e. faceless babies). Overall it has a very serious tone and message and I don&#8217;t think I expected that.</p>



<p>So whether I <em>enjoyed</em> it in the traditional sense is the wrong question, but I am still glad I read it. </p>



<h2>Why am I glad?</h2>



<p>Infinite Jest is unlike anything else I have ever read. </p>



<p>Not only has Wallace an utterly uniquely distinctive style which is <a href="https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2015/01/05/if-hemingway-wrote-javascript-explained/#DFW">impossible</a> to copy, but above all &#8212; this book makes you work! Some books you can read in one sitting, with Infinite Jest I could do 20 pages per hour at most, before I was spent. I could not read this book for hours on end. Because it <strong>demands your complete and undivided attention</strong>. And this can be exhausting. And at times it felt my life was on hold reading it (would I be able to finish it, where is this going?). </p>



<p>Nothing in the story is left <strong>unexplored </strong>and Wallace&#8217;s vocabulary is unmatched (there are over <a href="https://dfwwords.wordpress.com/">20.000 unique words</a> in Infinite Jest, this is only rivaled by the dictionary I would think&#8230;).  And on top of that, he makes up his own words to fit a specific mood or sentence. This makes the reading experience draining. </p>



<p>However, no word seems wasted. Every word seems vital. It is verbose but still perfectly tight prose.</p>



<p>All these things make it a different, but rewarding, reading experience. </p>



<h3>A book book</h3>



<p>I was also left with the idea that this <strong><em>experience </em></strong>can only exist on paper (or at most maybe an audiobook). There is <strong>no other way</strong> to convey the meaning &#8212; which just happen to be expressed by words &#8212; of this book.  You cannot retell the story, you cannot film the scenes, you would lose everything. I know there are also translations, but I worry that a translation wouldn&#8217;t provide the same experience. </p>



<p>Wallace demonstrates and justifies with Infinite Jest that writing is an art form of its own and that reading is a different experience from anything else.</p>



<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTFy8RnUkoU"><img src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/InfiniteJest-BillGates-1024x572.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3123" /></a>Hey, me too Bill! Just read it. 



<h2>All this seems difficult</h2>



<p>On top of all this, it is also mostly a non-lineair story, jumping from the &#8216;Tennis Academy&#8217; to the &#8216;Recovery House&#8217; and all over the place. The story seems like <strong>loosely connected collection of <em><span>shards</span></em></strong>. And you could <em>almost</em> crack it open anywhere and have the same experience as when you start on page one. I think this is deliberate: it makes your brain work. You have to make the connections yourself. Just like there are no <em>explainers</em> or introductions anywhere.</p>



<p>But I suspect this also aided Wallace&#8217;s writing? I sense these <em>fragments</em>, sometimes only separated by a double space, are different writing days (?) because they sometimes differ heavily in tone, ideas and intensity.</p>



<h2>So what&#8217;s it all about then?!</h2>



<p>There are many, many different themes and many different ideas in this book. Just as there are a couple of general commonalities. One commonality that stood out specifically for me is that <strong>every character in this book is flawed.</strong> And trust me, there are many characters. Drug addicts, wheelchair assassins, rapists, dealers, handicapped, deformed, talented athletes who threw their life away, you name it: but every character is flawed.</p>



<h3>Suffering </h3>



<p>This brings me to what I personally derived as one of the main recurring subjects of the book: <strong>suffering</strong>. Everyone and everything is <em>suffering</em> from <em>something</em>. The <em>human condition</em>, and in particular its flaws, are at the center of what drives the story. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YacuKLAcK6w">Wallace himself states</a> that one of the main messages of Infinite Jest is that &#8220;<strong>pleasure is dangerous</strong>&#8220;. Specifically: too much pleasure. We are flawed human beings with little to no self-control and a need for pleasure. And this causes problems.</p>



<p><strong>Maybe that&#8217;s why he makes the reader work so hard in what could have been a self-referential book <a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/nofear/shakespeare/hamlet/page_288/">title</a>. Pleasure should always be balanced out by hard work. </strong></p>



<img src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Broken-InfiniteJest-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3126" />Breaking its back! 



<h2>This Wallace guy is quite the character!</h2>



<p>Yes, you are nothing short of a genius when you can write like this. And from his <a href="https://j11g.com/2019/08/08/a-supposedly-fun-thing-ill-never-do-again-david-foster-wallace/">collection of essays</a> I had already concluded, he was a chameleon, able to effortlessly jump between different styles.  But I have often wondered how deep he had to go as a writer to write Infinite Jest. Because whoever wrote this must have balanced on the brink of madness and peered over (I had the same experience with <a href="https://j11g.com/2019/01/03/to-the-lighthouse-virginia-woolf/">Virginia Woolf</a>). </p>



<p>But this is also what kept me from enjoying the book to its fullest I think. I don&#8217;t mind working hard for a book. But when I read Infinite Jest I was 50% of the time immersed in the story and 50% of the time thinking: how did he do this?! How does his brain work? How can someone write this? It really threw me off. </p>



<p>But either way, in the end, just <em>that</em> may be one of the most rewarding experiences from this book. It&#8217;s like you get to spend some time in the mind of a genius, and you may not fully understand the machinery and mechanism but you are certainly in on the outcomes. </p>



<h2>Now what?</h2>



<p>I heard a great quote: &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1KV9-GlzI">you might just finish the book and see hints of Infinite Jest in everything that is around you</a>&#8220;. I think that is true, this book <strong>cannot but leave a mark</strong>, and make you see the world through a different lens. And I am glad I am in on it now. And yes, Wallace in 1996 was able to foresee and extrapolate developments with regards to humans and their relation to <em>pleasure </em>(whether this is technology or drugs) that raise questions that are alarmingly relevant today.</p>



<p>At times I thought: when I am finished I am never reading this again! But at other times I thought: this is exceptional I should reread this every so often. (Somewhere in the first few hundreds pages is a story of an addict waiting for a <em>hit</em>. It is <span>quite</span> something). I also made hundreds of yellow marks I want to revisit for various reasons and I want to read more by Wallace. Also there are many Infinite Jest <a href="https://infinitejest.wallacewiki.com/david-foster-wallace/index.php?title=Main_Page">resources I want to read</a> to see what I might have missed (I suspect quite a bit). However, there are also <a href="https://books.j11g.com/">many more books</a> I also want to read of course.  </p>



<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3Yjx4PKIkk"><img src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/InfiniteJest-RyanHoliday-1024x577.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3124" /></a> Yeah? Well, you know, that&#8217;s just like uh, your opinion, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95kNwZw8YY">man</a>.



<h2>Should *I* read it?</h2>



<p>Yes. However, I can&#8217;t promise you will enjoy it. And it is an expensive investment of your time (then again, finishing a great <a href="https://j11g.com/2018/11/26/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-red-dead-redemption-2/">video game</a> costs the same amount of time). But the experience of Infinite Jest will be rewarding because it will be unlike anything you have ever read.</p>



<p>Lock the door, turn off your phone and enter the mind of David Foster Wallace. </p>

An adversary with sufficient leverage can bypass the computational cost of a conventional attack by exerting their influence on this person.</p>

<p>The technique is sometimes referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis">rubber-hose cryptanalysis</a> and it gives the adversary some serious creative freedom. The security properties of the cryptosystem now rely not on the assumed difficulty of mathematical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapdoor_function">trapdoor functions</a> but on some person’s tolerance to physical or psychological violence. A thief knows that pointing a gun will unlock a safe much faster than using a drill.

The penalty for refusing to hand over key material is up to two years in prison.</p>

<p>Say Alice has a cryptosystem <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">Ck C_k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathdefault">C</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span><span class="pstrut"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathdefault mtight">k</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> whose security properties rely on the secrecy of the key <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span></span></span></span>. To defend against attacks of this form Alice needs some way to keep <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span></span></span></span> a secret. She could,</p>

<ol>
  <li>Claim that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span></span></span></span> is not known. This includes if it has been lost or forgotten.</li>
  <li>Claim the ciphertext <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">c c </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">c</span></span></span></span> is random noise and so is not decryptable.</li>
  <li>Provide an alternate key <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">j j </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">j</span></span></span></span> under which decryption produces a fake plaintext.</li>
</ol>

<p>Suppose Mallory is the adversary who wants <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span></span></span></span> and suppose Alice makes a claim <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">X X </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">X</span></span></span></span> in order to avoid revealing <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span></span></span></span>. Defining success can be tricky as Mallory can ultimately decide not to believe any claim that Alice makes. However we will simply say Mallory wins if she can show <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">¬X \neg X </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord">¬</span><span class="mord mathdefault">X</span></span></span></span> and therefore assert that Alice has access to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span></span></span></span> and is able to provide it. So for Alice to win, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">X X </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">X</span></span></span></span> must be unfalsifiable and hence a <strong>plausible</strong> defence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a side note, if Alice knows and can demonstrate <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">¬X \neg X </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord">¬</span><span class="mord mathdefault">X</span></span></span></span> whereas Mallory cannot, then clearly she is missing some necessary information. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle">Kerckhoffs’s principle</a> says that the security of a cryptosystem <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">Ck C_k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathdefault">C</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span><span class="pstrut"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathdefault mtight">k</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> should rely solely on the secrecy of the key <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span></span></span></span>, so in general we want proving <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">¬X \neg X </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord">¬</span><span class="mord mathdefault">X</span></span></span></span> to require knowing <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span></span></span></span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We will ignore weaknesses related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security">operational security</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)">implementation</a>. For example if Mallory hears Alice admit to Bob that she is lying or if she finds a fragment of plaintext in memory then Alice has lost. However these situations are difficult to cryptographically protect against and so we assume security in this regard.</p>

<p>Pleading ignorance (<strong>1</strong>) of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span></span></span></span> is an easy strategy for Alice as it leaves little room for dispute and it can be deployed as a tactic almost anywhere. Mallory must show that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span></span></span></span> <em>is</em> known and this is difficult to do without actually producing it. Perhaps the key was on a USB device that has been lost, or was written down on a piece of paper that burned down along with Alice’s house. Mere forgetfulness however implies that the data does exist and the only barrier to retrieving it is in accessing Alice’s memories. This may not be satisfactory.</p>

<p>Asserting the non-existence (<strong>2</strong>) of the ciphertext is equivalent to claiming that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span></span></span></span> does not exist and so cannot be disclosed. Plausibility comes from the fact that ciphertext is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_indistinguishability">indistinguishable from random noise</a>. This means that given some potential ciphertext <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">c c </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">c</span></span></span></span> an adversary cannot say if <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">c c </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">c</span></span></span></span> is uniformly sampled or if <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">c=Ek(m) c = E_k(m) </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">c</span><span class="mspace"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathdefault">E</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span><span class="pstrut"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathdefault mtight">k</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathdefault">m</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> is a valid message <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">m m </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">m</span></span></span></span> encrypted under some key <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span></span></span></span>. To prove that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">c c </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">c</span></span></span></span> is not random noise Mallory must produce <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k k </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span></span></span></span> and compute <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">m m </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">m</span></span></span></span>, which is assumed to be infeasible.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#Plausible_deniability">TrueCrypt</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeraCrypt#Plausible_deniability">VeraCrypt</a> allow the creation of <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Hidden%20Volume.html">hidden volumes</a> and <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/VeraCrypt%20Hidden%20Operating%20System.html">hidden operating systems</a>. The idea is that an ordinary encrypted volume will have unused regions of the disk filled with random data, and so a hidden volume can be placed there without revealing its existence.</p>

<p>Suppose we have a boot drive with a standard volume protected by the key <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k1 k_1 </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span><span class="pstrut"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and a hidden volume protected by the key <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k2 k_2 </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span><span class="pstrut"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. The existence of the unencrypted boot-loader reveals the fact that the standard volume exists and so Mallory can confidently demand its key. Alice may safely provide Mallory with <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k1 k_1 </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span><span class="pstrut"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> thereby revealing the innocuous contents of the standard volume. However when Alice enters <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">k2 k_2 </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathdefault">k</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span><span class="pstrut"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, the boot-loader fails to unlock the standard region so instead it tries to decrypt at the offset where the hidden volume’s header would reside. If the hidden volume exists and if the provided key is correct, this operation is successful and the boot-loader proceeds to boot the hidden operating system.</p>

<p>This is an example of providing a decoy decryption (<strong>3</strong>) but you may notice that Alice also had to claim that the remaining “unused” space on the drive is random noise (<strong>2</strong>) and not valid ciphertext. The necessity of a secondary claim is not a special case but a general property of systems that try to provide deniability in this way.</p>

<center><i>It's possible to distinguish ciphertext from data from this randomness source.</i></center>

<p>Providing a plausible reason for the existence of leftover data can be tricky. VeraCrypt relies on the fact that drives are often <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Disk_encryption#Preparing_the_disk">wiped with random data</a> before being used as encrypted volumes. In other situations we may have to be sneakier.</p>

<p>This strategy does have some practical limitations. If the volume hosts an operating system, the innocuous OS has to be used as frequently as the hidden one to make it seem legitimate. For example if Alice provides the key and Mallory sees that the last login was two years ago, but she knows that Alice logged in the day before, then Mallory can be pretty sure something is off. Also consider what happens if Mallory sees a snapshot of the drive before and after some data is modified in the hidden volume. She then knows that there is data there and that it is not simply the remnants of an earlier wipe.</p>

<p>Imagine a huge library where every book is full of gibberish. There is a librarian who will help you store and retrieve your data within the library. You give her a bunch of data and a master key. She uses the master key to derive an encryption key and a random location oracle. The data is then split into book-sized pieces, each of which is encrypted with the derived key. Finally each encrypted book is stored at a location provided by the oracle.</p>

<p>Suppose the library contains <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">n n </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">n</span></span></span></span> books in total. Mallory cannot say anything about Alice’s data apart from that its total size is less than or equal to the amount of data that can be stored within <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">n n </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">n</span></span></span></span> books. If, under duress, Alice is forced to reveal a decoy key that pieces together data from <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">m m </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">m</span></span></span></span> books, she needs some way to explain the remaining <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">n−m n - m </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">n</span><span class="mspace"></span><span class="mbin">−</span><span class="mspace"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">m</span></span></span></span> books that were not used. She could claim that,</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>The key for those books has been lost or forgotten.</li>
<li>They are composed of random noise and so cannot be decrypted.</li>
<li>They belong to other people and so the key is not known to her.</li>
</ol>

<p>This will look mostly familiar. Alice is trying to avoid revealing her actual data by providing a decoy key that unlocks some innocuous data. She then has to make a secondary claim in order to explain the remaining data that was not decrypted under the provided key.</p>

<p>Claiming ignorance (<strong>A</strong>) has the same trivial plausibility argument and practical limitation as before (<strong>1</strong>).</p>

<p>Asserting that the leftover books are composed of random bytes (<strong>B</strong>) requires an explanation for <em>how</em> they came to be there. She could say simply that she added them but this is a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/can_of_worms">can of worms</a> that we want to keep closed. If some software implementation decides how many decoy books to add, it would necessarily leak information to Mallory about the <em>expected</em> frequency of decoys. This value can be compared with Alice’s claim of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">n−m n - m </span><span class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">n</span><span class="mspace"></span><span class="mbin">−</span><span class="mspace"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">m</span></span></span></span> decoys to come up with an indicator of whether Alice is lying.</p>

<p>We have the same problem if the frequency is decided randomly as the value would have to lie within some range. We can get around this by asking Alice herself to decide the frequency, but this is messy and humans are bad at being unpredictable. In any case, this strategy boils down to Alice claiming “I added decoy entries explicitly in order to explain leftover data”, and this would rightly make an adversary extremely suspicious.</p>

<p>A better way to utilise <strong>B</strong> is for Faythe to replace books that are to be deleted with random data instead of removing them outright. Then Alice can claim that the remaining books have been deleted and therefore the data no longer exists and cannot be decrypted. This way potentially any number of leftover books can be easily explained, but it does mean that the size of our library will only increase over time.</p>

<p>Claim <strong>C</strong> is new and has some appealing properties but it can’t be used on a personal storage medium—like Alice’s laptop hard drive—as there is unlikely to be a plausible reason for other people’s data to be there. Imagine instead that the “library” is hosted on a service shared by multiple people. Then it is easy for Alice to claim that the remaining entries are not hers. Mallory would need leverage over every other person using the service in order to disprove Alice’s claim. Such a service has to be carefully designed however. For example if it stored how much space Alice is using then this value can be compared with Alice’s claim and Mallory wins.</p>

<p>There are some drawbacks of this scheme. There is an overhead in storing data in discrete, padded chunks. Modifying data in a non-trivial way may be expensive. Overwriting entries instead of removing them uses up storage space that is “wasted” in the sense that it does not hold any useful data. In designing this protocol what I have found is that we have to be <strong>extremely careful</strong> to avoid losing our deniability. Any implementation has to be verified to ensure that it does not fall short in this regard.</p>

<p>However we now have something that lets you have an arbitrary number of independent “folders” stored amongst numerous indistinguishable packets, with an adversary being unable to infer any information other than the maximum size of the stored data. This is a powerful property but it should be considered as part of the whole picture including your threat model and usability requirements.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is an experimental client implementing the spirit of this protocol <a href="https://github.com/awnumar/gravity">here</a>. As of the time of writing, <strong>it is not ready for serious use</strong>. However there are some exciting ideas I have for making this into a production ready and usable client in the (hopefully) near future.</p>

<h1>Firecracker: Lightweight Virtualization for Serverless Applications</h1>

<p class="meta">Our second paper for NSDI'20.</p>


<p>In 2018, we announced <a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/">Firecracker</a>, an <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker">open source</a> VMM optimized for multi-tenant serverless and container workloads. We heard some interest from the research community, and in response wrote up our reasoning behind building Firecracker, and how its used inside AWS Lambda.</p>

<p>That paper was accepted to NSDI'20, and is <a href="https://www.amazon.science/publications/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-applications">available here</a>. Here's the abstract:</p>

<blockquote><p>Serverless containers and functions are widely used for deploying and managing software in the cloud. Their popularity is due to reduced cost of operations, improved utilization of hardware, and faster scaling than traditional deployment methods. The economics and scale of serverless applications demand that workloads from multiple customers run on the same hardware with minimal overhead, while preserving strong security and performance isolation. The traditional view is that there is a choice between virtualization with strong security and high overhead, and container technologies with weaker security and minimal overhead. This tradeoff is unacceptable to public infrastructure providers, who need both strong security and minimal overhead. To meet this need, we developed Fire-cracker, a new open source Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)specialized for serverless workloads, but generally useful for containers, functions and other compute workloads within a reasonable set of constraints. We have deployed Firecracker in two publically available serverless compute services at Amazon Web Services (Lambda and Fargate), where it supports millions of production workloads, and trillions of requests per month. We describe how specializing for serverless in-formed the design of Firecracker, and what we learned from seamlessly migrating Lambda customers to Firecracker.</p></blockquote>

<p>Like any project the size of Firecracker, it was developed by a team of people from vision to execution. I played only a small role in that, but it's been great to work with the team (and the community) on getting Firecracker out, adding features, and using it in production at pretty huge scale.</p>

<p>Firecracker is a little bit unusual among software projects of having an explicit goal of being simple and well-suited for a relatively small number of tasks. That doesn't mean it's simplistic. Choosing what to do, and what not to do, was some of the most interesting decisions to be made in it's development. I'm particularly proud of how well the team made those decisions, and continues to make them.</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>If you read any personal finance forums late last year, there's a decent chance you ran across a question from someone who was desperately trying to lose money before the end of the year. There are a number of ways someone could do this; one commonly suggested scheme was to buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_option">put options that were expected to expire worthless</a>, allowing the buyer to (probably) take a loss.</p>

<p>One reason people were looking for ways to lose money was that, in the U.S., there's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Subsidy_Cliff_at_400%_FPL">a hard income cutoff for a health insurance subsidy</a> at $48,560 for individuals (higher for larger households; $100,400 for a family of four). There are a number of factors that can cause the details to vary (age, location, household size, type of plan), but across all circumstances, it wouldn't have been uncommon for an individual going from one side of the cut-off to the other to have their health insurance cost increase by roughly $7200/yr. That means if an individual buying ACA insurance was going to earn $55k, they'd be better off reducing their income by $6440 and getting under the $48,560 subsidy ceiling than they are earning $55k.</p>

<p>Although that's an unusually severe example, <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/11-15-2012-MarginalTaxRates.pdf">U.S. tax policy is full of discontinuities that disincentivize increasing earnings and, in some cases, actually incentivize decreasing earnings</a>. Some other discontinuities are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Assistance_for_Needy_Families">TANF</a> income limit, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid">Medicaid</a> income limit, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Health_Insurance_Program">CHIP</a> income limit for free coverage, and the CHIP income limit for reduced-cost coverage. These vary by location and circumstance; the TANF and Medicaid income limits fall into ranges generally considered to be &quot;low income&quot; and the CHIP limits fall into ranges generally considered to be &quot;middle class&quot;. These subsidy discontinuities have the same impact as the ACA subsidy discontinuity -- at certain income levels, people are incentivized to lose money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyone may arrange his affairs so that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose that pattern which best pays the treasury. There is not even a patriotic duty to increase one's taxes. Over and over again the Courts have said that there is nothing sinister in so arranging affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible. Everyone does it, rich and poor alike and all do right, for nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you agree with the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_Hand">Learned Hand</a> quote then losing money in order to reduce effective tax rate, increasing disposable income, is completely legitimate behavior at the individual level. However, a tax system that encourages people to lose money, perhaps by funneling it to (on average) much wealthier options traders by buying put options, seems sub-optimal.</p>

<p>A simple fix for the problems mentioned above would be to have slow phase-outs instead of sharp thresholds. Slow phase-outs are actually done for some subsidies and, while that can also have problems, they are typically less problematic than introducing a sharp discontinuity in tax/subsidy policy.</p>

<p>In this post, we'll look at a variety of discontinuities.</p>

<h3 id="hardware-or-software-queues">Hardware or software queues</h3>

<p>A naive queue has discontinuous behavior. If the queue is full, new entries are dropped. If the queue isn't full, new entries are not dropped. Depending on your goals, this can often have impacts that are non-ideal. For example, in networking, a naive queue might be considered &quot;unfair&quot; to bursty workloads that have low overall bandwidth utilization because workloads that have low bandwidth utilization &quot;shouldn't&quot; suffer more drops than workloads that are less bursty but use more bandwidth (this is also arguably not unfair, depending on what your goals are).</p>

<p>A class of solutions to this problem are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_early_detection">random early drop</a> and its variants, which gives incoming items a probability of being dropped which can be determined by queue fullness (and possibly other factors), smoothing out the discontinuity and mitigating issues caused by having a discontinuous probability of queue drops.</p>

<p><a href="http://danluu.com/randomize-hn/">This post on voting in link aggregators</a> is fundamentally the same idea although, in some sense, the polarity is reversed. There's a very sharp discontinuity in how much traffic something gets based on whether or not it's on the front page. You could view this as a link getting dropped from a queue if it only receives N-1 votes and not getting dropped if it receives N votes.</p>

<h3 id="college-admissions-and-pell-grant-recipients-https-www-insidehighered-com-admissions-article-2019-01-28-study-pressure-enroll-more-pell-eligible-students-has-skewed-colleges"><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2019/01/28/study-pressure-enroll-more-pell-eligible-students-has-skewed-colleges">College admissions and Pell Grant recipients</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell_Grant">Pell Grants</a> started getting used as a proxy for how serious schools are about helping/admitting low-income students. The first order impact is that students above the Pell Grant threshold had a significantly reduced probability of being admitted while students below the Pell Grant threshold had a significantly higher chance of being admitted. Phrased that way, it sounds like things are working as intended.</p>

<p>However, when we look at what happens within each group, we see outcomes that are the opposite of what we'd want if the goal is to benefit students from low income families. Among people who don't qualify for a Pell Grant, it's those with the lowest income who are the most severely impacted and have the most severely reduced probability of admission. Among people who do qualify, it's those with the highest income who are mostly likely to benefit, again the opposite of what you'd probably want if your goal is to benefit students from low income families.</p>

<p>We can see these in the graphs below, which are histograms of parental income among students at two universities in 2008 (first graph) and 2016 (second graph), where the red line indicates the Pell Grant threshold.</p>

<p><img src="http://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/pell-2008.jpg" alt="Histogram of income distribution of students at two universities in 2008; high incomes are highly overrepresented relative to the general population, but the distribution is smooth" height="816" width="1056" /></p>

<p><img src="http://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/pell-2016.jpg" alt="Histogram of income distribution of students at two universities in 2016; high incomes are still highly overrepresented, there's also a sharp discontinuity at the Pell grant threshold; plot looks roughly two upwards sloping piecewise linear functions, with a drop back to nearly 0 at the discontinuity at the Pell grant threshold" height="816" width="1056" /></p>

<p>A second order effect of universities optimizing for Pell Grant recipients is that savvy parents can do the same thing that some people do to cut their taxable income at the last minute. Someone might put money into a traditional IRA instead of a Roth IRA and, if they're at their IRA contribution limit, they can try to lose money on options, effectively transferring money to options traders who are likely to be wealthier than them, in order to bring their income below the Pell Grant threshold, increasing the probability that their children will be admitted to a selective school.</p>

<h3 id="election-statistics-https-arxiv-org-pdf-1410-6059-pdf"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6059.pdf">Election statistics</a></h3>

<p>The following histograms of Russian elections across polling stations shows curious spikes in turnout and results at nice, round, numbers (e.g., 95%) starting around 2004. This appears to indicate that there's election fraud via fabricated results and that at least some of the people fabricating results don't bother with fabricating results that have a smooth distribution.</p>

<p><img src="http://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/russian-elections.png" height="1418" width="1822" /></p>

<p>For finding fraudulent numbers, also see, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law">Benford's law</a>.</p>

<h3 id="p-values-https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-p-value"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value">p-values</a></h3>

<p>Authors of psychology papers are incentivized to produce papers with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value">p values</a> below some threshold, usually 0.05, but sometimes 0.1 or 0.01. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22853650">Masicampo et al. plotted p values from papers published in three psychology journals</a> and found a curiously high number of papers with p values just below 0.05.</p>

<p><img src="http://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/p-value.png" alt="Histogram of published p-values; spike at p=0.05" height="1000" width="1874" /></p>

<p>The spike at p = 0.05 consistent with a number of hypothesis that aren't great, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Authors are fudging results to get p = 0.05</li>
<li>Journals are much more likely to accept a paper with p = 0.05 than if p = 0.055</li>
<li>Authors are much less likely to submit results if p = 0.055 than if p = 0.05</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4359000/">Head et al. (2015)</a> surveys the evidence across a number of fields.</p>

<p>Andrew Gelman and others have been campaigning to get rid of the idea of statistical significance and p-value thresholds for years, <a href="https://stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/abandon.pdf">see this paper for a short summary of why</a>. Not only would this reduce the incentive for authors to cheat on p values, there are other reasons to not want a bright-line rule to determine if something is &quot;significant&quot; or not.</p>

<h3 id="drug-charges-http-econweb-umd-edu-tuttle-files-tuttle-mandatory-minimums-pdf"><a href="http://econweb.umd.edu/~tuttle/files/tuttle_mandatory_minimums.pdf">Drug charges</a></h3>

<p>The top two graphs in this set of four show histograms of the amount of cocaine people were charged with possessing before and after the passing of the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010, which raised the amount of cocaine necessary to trigger the 10-year mandatory minimum prison sentence for possession from 50g to 280g. There's a relatively smooth distribution before 2010 and a sharp discontinuity after 2010.</p>

<p>The bottom-left graph shows the sharp spike in prosecutions at 280 grams followed by what might be a drop in 2013 after evidentiary standards were changed<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:R"><a rel="footnote" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fn:R">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="http://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/cocaine-280.png" height="1118" width="1408" /></p>

<h3 id="birth-month-and-sports">Birth month and sports</h3>

<p>These are scatterplots of football (soccer) players in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Youth_League">UEFA Youth League</a>. The x-axis on both of these plots is how old players are modulo the year, i.e., their birth month normalized from 0 to 1.</p>

<p>The graph on the left is a histogram, which shows that there is a very strong relationship between where a person's birth falls within the year and their odds of making a club at the UEFA Youth League (U19) level. The graph on the right purports to show that birth time is only weakly correlated with actual value provided on the field. The authors use playing time as a proxy for value, presumably because it's easy to measure. That's not a great measure, but the result they find (younger-within-the-year players have higher value, conditional on making the U19 league) is consistent with other studies on sports and discrimination, which ind (for example) that <a href="https://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/">black baseball players were significantly better than white baseball players for decades after desegregation in baseball, French-Canadian defensemen are also better than average (French-Canadians are stereotypically afraid to fight, don't work hard enough, and are too focused on offense)</a>.</p>

<p>The discontinuity isn't directly shown in the graphs above because the graphs only show birth date for one year. If we were to plot birth date by cohort across multiple years, we'd expect to see a sawtooth pattern in the probability that a player makes it into the UEFA youth league with a 10x difference between someone born one day before vs. after the threshold.</p>

<p><img src="http://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/u19-age.png" height="1030" width="1758" /></p>

<p>This phenomenon, that birth day or month is a good predictor of participation in higher-level youth sports as well as pro sports, has been studied across a variety of sports.</p>

<p>It's generally believed that this is caused by a discontinuity in youth sports:</p>

<ol>
<li>Kids are bucketed into groups by age in years and compete against people in the same year</li>
<li>Within a given year, older kids are stronger, faster, etc., and perform better</li>
<li>This causes older-within-year kids to outcompete younger kids, which later results in older-within-year kids having higher levels of participation for a variety of reasons</li>
</ol>

<p>This is arguably a &quot;bug&quot; in how youth sports works. But <a href="http://danluu.com/bad-decisions/">as we've seen in baseball</a> <a href="http://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/">as well as a survey of multiple sports</a>, obviously bad decision making that costs individual teams tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars can persist for decades in the face of people pubicly discussing how bad the decisions are. In this case, the youth sports teams aren't feeder teams to pro teams, so they don't have a financial incentive to select players who are skilled for their age (as opposed to just taller and faster because they're slightly older) so this system-wide non-optimal even more difficult to fix than pro sports teams making locally non-optimal decisions that are completely under their control.</p>

<h3 id="high-school-exit-exam-scores-danluu-com-matura-2013-pdf"><a href="http://danluu.com/matura-2013.pdf">High school exit exam scores</a></h3>

<p>This is a histogram of high school exit exam scores from the Polish language exam. We can see that a curiously high number of students score 30 or just above thirty while curiously low number of students score from 23-29. This is from 2013; other years I've looked at (2010-2012) show a similar discontinuity.</p>

<p>Math exit exam scores don't exhibit any unusual discontinuities in the years I've examined (2010-2013).</p>

<p><img src="http://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/matura-polish-2013.png" height="772" width="1416" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1bqf9r/unusual_distributions_of_scores_on_final/c994zxt/">An anonymous reddit commenter explains this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When a teacher is grading matura (final HS exam), he/she doesn't know whose test it is. The only things that are known are: the number (code) of the student and the district which matura comes from (it is usually from completely different part of Poland). The system is made to prevent any kind of manipulation, for example from time to time teachers supervisor will come to check if test are graded correctly. I don't wanna talk much about system flaws (and advantages), it is well known in every education system in the world where final tests are made, but you have to keep in mind that there is a key, which teachers follow very strictly when grading.</p>

<p>So, when a score of the test is below 30%, exam is failed. However, before making final statement in protocol, a commision of 3 (I don't remember exact number) is checking test again. This is the moment, where difference between humanities and math is shown: teachers often try to find a one (or a few) missing points, so the test won't be failed, because it's a tragedy to this person, his school and somewhat fuss for the grading team. Finding a &quot;missing&quot; point is not that hard when you are grading writing or open questions, which is a case in polish language, but nearly impossible in math. So that's the reason why distribution of scores is so different.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with p values, having a bright-line threshold, causes curious behavior. In this case, scoring below 30 on any subject (a 30 or above is required in every subject) and failing the exam has arbitrary negative effects for people, so teachers usually try to prevent people from failing if there's an easy way to do it, but a deeper root of the problem is the idea that it's necessary to produce a certification that's the discretization of a continuous score.</p>

<h3 id="procurement-auctions-http-www-keikawai-com-full-0804-pdf"><a href="http://www.keikawai.com/Full_0804.pdf">Procurement auctions</a></h3>

<p>Kawai et al. looked at Japanese government procurement, in order to find suspicious pattern of bids like the ones described in <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w4013">Porter et al. (1993)</a>, which looked at collusion in procurement auctions on Long Island (in New York in the United States). One example that's given is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In February 1983, the New York State Department of Transportation (DoT) held a pro- curement auction for resurfacing 0.8 miles of road. The lowest bid in the auction was $4 million, and the DoT decided not to award the contract because the bid was deemed too high relative to its own cost estimates. The project was put up for a reauction in May 1983 in which all the bidders from the initial auction participated. The lowest bid in the reauction was 20% higher than in the initial auction, submitted by the previous low bidder. Again, the contract was not awarded. The DoT held a third auction in February 1984, with the same set of bidders as in the initial auction. The lowest bid in the third auction was 10% higher than the second time, again submitted by the same bidder. The DoT apparently thought this was suspicious: “It is notable that the same firm submitted the low bid in each of the auctions. Because of the unusual bidding patterns, the contract was not awarded through 1987.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It could be argued that this is expected because different firms have different cost structures, so the lowest bidder in an auction for one particular project should be expected to be the lowest bidder in subsequent auctions for the same project. In order to distinguish between collusion and real structural cost differences between firms, Kawai et al. (2015) looked at auctions where the difference in bid between the first and second place firms was very small, making the winner effectively random.</p>

<p>In the auction structure studied, bidders submit a secret bid. If the secret bid is above a secret minimum, then the lowest bidder wins the auction and gets the contract. If not, the lowest bid is revealed to all bidders and another round of bidding is done. Kawai et al. found that, in about 97% of auctions, the bidder who submitted the lowest bid in the first round also submitted the lowest bid in the second round (the probability that the second lowest bidder remains second lowest was 26%).</p>

<p>Below, is a histogram of the difference in first and second round bids between the first-lowest and second-lowest bidders (left column) and the second-lowest and third-lowest bidders (right column). Each row has a different filtering criteria for how close the auction has to be in order to be included. In the top row, all auctions that reached the third round were included; in second, and third rows, the normalized delta between the first and second biders was less than 0.05 and 0.01, respectively; in the last row, the normalized delta between the first and the third bidder was less than 0.03. All numbers are normalized because the absolute size of auctions can vary.</p>

<p><img src="http://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/jp-procurement-bidding.png" height="1446" width="1682" /></p>

<p>We can see that the distributions of deltas between the first and second round are roughly symmetrical when comparing second and third lowest bidders. But when comparing first and second lowest bidders, there's a sharp discontinuity at zero, indicating that second-lowest bidder almost never lowers their bid by more than the first-lower bidder did. If you read the paper, you can see that the same structure persists into auctions that go into a third round.</p>

<p>I don't mean to pick on Japanese procurement auctions in particular. There's an extensive literature on procurement auctions that's found collusion in many cases, often much more blatant than the case presented above (e.g., there are a few firms and they round-robin who wins across auctions, or there are a handful of firms and every firm except for the winner puts in the same losing bid).</p>

<p>The histograms below show a sharp discontinuity between 13 and 14, which is the difference between an A grade and a B grade. It appears that some regions also have a discontinuity between 27 and 28, which is the difference between a B and a C and <a href="https://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/76928412519/think-nyc-restaurant-grading-is-flawed-heres">this older analysis from 2014</a> found what appears to be a similar discontinuity between B and C grades.</p>

<p>Inspectors have discretion in what violations are tallied and it appears that there are cases where restaurant are nudged up to the next higher grade.</p>

<p>A histogram of marathon finishing times (finish times on the x-axis, count on the y-axis) across 9,789,093 finishes shows noticeable discontinuities at every half hour, as well as at &quot;round&quot; times like :10, :15, and :20.</p>

<p>An analysis of times within each race (<a href="http://danluu.com/faculty.chicagobooth.edu/devin.pope/research/pdf/Website_Marathons.pdf">see section 4.4, figures 7-9</a>) indicates that this is at least partially because people speed up (or slow down less than usual) towards the end of races if they're close to a &quot;round&quot; time<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:M"><a rel="footnote" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fn:M">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>This post doesn't really have a goal or a point, it's just a collection of discontinuities that I find fun.</p>

<p>One thing that's maybe worth noting is that I've gotten a lot of mileage out in my career both out of being suspicious of discontinuities and figuring out where they come from and also out of applying standard techniques to smooth out discontinuities.</p>

<p>For finding discontinuities, basic tools like &quot;drawing a scatterplot&quot;, &quot;<a href="http://danluu.com/perf-tracing/#histogram">drawing a histogram</a>&quot;, &quot;drawing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function">CDF</a>&quot; often come in handy. Other kinds of visualizations that add temporality, like <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope">flamescope</a>, can also come in handy.</p>

<p>We <a href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#hardware-or-software-queues">noted above that queues create a kind of discontinuity that, in some circumstances, should be smoothed out</a>. We also noted that we see similar behavior for other kinds of thresholds and that randomization can be a useful tool to smooth out discontinuities in thresholds as well. Randomization can also be used to allow for reducing quantization error when reducing precision with ML and in other applications.</p>

<li id="fn:R"><p>Most online commentary I've seen about this paper is incorrect. I've seen this paper used as evidence of police malfeasance because the amount of cocaine seized jumped to 280g. This is the opposite of what's described in the paper, where the author notes that, based on drug seizure records, amounts seized do not appear to be the cause of this change. After noting that drug seizures are not the cause, the author notes that prosecutors can charge people for amounts that are not the same as the amount seized and then notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do find bunching at 280g after 2010 in case management data from the Executive Office of the US Attorney (EOUSA). I also find that approximately 30% of prosecutors are responsible for the rise in cases with 280g after 2010, and that there is variation in prosecutor-level bunching both within and between districts. Prosecutors who bunch cases at 280g also have a high share of cases right above 28g after 2010 (the 5-year threshold post-2010) and a high share of cases above 50g prior to 2010 (the 10-year threshold pre-2010). Also, bunching above a mandatory minimum threshold persists across districts for prosecutors who switch districts. Moreover, when a “bunching” prosecutor switches into a new district, all other attorneys in that district increase their own bunching at mandatory minimums. These results suggest that the observed bunching at sentencing is specifically due to prosecutorial discretion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is mentioned in the abstract and then expounded on in the introduction (the quoted passage is from the introduction), so I think that most people commenting on this paper can't have read it. I've done a few surveys of comments on papers on blog posts and I generally find that, in cases where it's possible to identify this (e.g., when the post is mistitled), the vast majority of commenters can't have read the paper or post they're commenting on, but that's a topic for another post.</p>

<p>There is some evidence that something fishy may be going on in seizures (e.g., see Fig. A8.(c)), but if the analysis in the paper is correct, that impact of that is much smaller than the impact of prosecutorial discretion.</p>

<li id="fn:M">One of the most common comments I've seen online about this graph and/or this paper is that this is due to pace runners provided by the marathon.

<h1>Physalia: Millions of Tiny Databases</h1>

<p class="meta">Avoiding Hard CAP Tradeoffs</p>


<p>A few years ago, when I was still working on EBS, we started building a system called Physalia. Physalia is a custom transactional key-value store, designed to play the role of <em>configuration master</em> in the EBS architecture. Last year, we wrote a paper about Physalia, and were thrilled that it was accepted to NSDI'20.</p>

<p><a href="https://assets.amazon.science/c4/11/de2606884b63bf4d95190a3c2390/millions-of-tiny-databases.pdf">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> describes our problem and solution in detail. Here's the abstract:</p>

<blockquote><p>Starting in 2013, we set out to build a new database to act as the configuration store for a high-performance cloud block storage system Amazon EBS.
This database needs to be not only highly available, durable, and scalable but also strongly consistent. We quickly realized that the constraints on availability imposed by the CAP theorem, and the realities of operating distributed systems, meant that we didn't want one database. We wanted millions. Physalia is a transactional key-value store, optimized for use in large-scale cloud control planes, which takes advantage of knowledge of transaction patterns and infrastructure design to offer both high availability and strong consistency to millions of clients.
Physalia uses its knowledge of datacenter topology to place data where it is most likely to be available. Instead of being highly available for all keys to all clients, Physalia focuses on being extremely available for only the keys it knows each client needs, from the perspective of that client.
This paper describes Physalia in context of \amazon \ebs, and some other uses within \awsFull. We believe that the same patterns, and approach to design, are widely applicable to distributed systems problems like control planes, configuration management, and service discovery.</p></blockquote>

<p>I also wrote a post about Physalia <a href="https://www.amazon.science/blog/amazon-ebs-addresses-the-challenge-of-the-cap-theorem-at-scale">for the Amazon Science blog</a>.</p>

<p>One aspect of Physalia that I'm particular proud of is the work that we put in to correctness. We used TLA+ extensively throughout the design, and as documentation during implementation. As <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2014/08/09/formal-methods.html">we've published about before</a>, TLA+ is really well suited to these kinds of systems. We also automatically generated unit tests, an approach I haven't seen used elsewhere:</p>

<blockquote><p>In addition to unit testing, we adopted a number of other testing approaches. One of those approaches was a suite of automatically-generated tests which run the Paxos implementation through every combination of packet loss and re-ordering that a node can experience. This testing approach was inspired by the TLC model checker, and helped usbuild confidence that our implementation matched the formal specification.</p></blockquote>

<p>Check out <a href="https://assets.amazon.science/c4/11/de2606884b63bf4d95190a3c2390/millions-of-tiny-databases.pdf">our paper</a> if you'd like to learn more.</p></div>

<h4><a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2020/02/16/patterns-of-regular-expression-usage-duplicate-regexs/">Patterns of regular expression usage: duplicate regexs</a>

<span class="date">February 16, 2020 06:41 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Regular expressions are widely used, but until recently they were rarely studied empirically (i.e., just theory research).</p>
<p>This week I discovered two groups studying regular expression usage in source code.  The <a href="https://github.com/VTLeeLab">VTLeeLab</a> has various papers analysing 500K distinct regular expressions, from programs written in eight languages and StackOverflow; <a href="https://wangpeipei90.github.io/">Carl Chapman and Peipei Wang</a> have been looking at testing of regular expressions, and also ran an interesting experiment (I will write about this when I have decoded the data).</p>
<p>Regular expressions are interesting, in that their use is likely to be purely driven by an application requirement; the use of an integer literals may be driven by internal housekeeping requirements.  The number of times the same regular expression appears in source code provides an insight (I claim) into the number of times different programs are having to solve the same application problem.</p>
<p>The data made available by the VTLeeLab group provides lots of information about each distinct regular expression, but not a count of occurrences in source.  My email request for count data received a reply from <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/~davisjam/">James Davis</a> within the hour <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>The plot below (<a href="http://www.coding-guidelines.com/code-data/RegexGeneralizability.tgz">code+data</a>; <code>crates.io</code> has not been included because the number of regexs extracted is much smaller than the other repos) shows the number of unique patterns (y-axis) against the number of identical occurrences of each unique pattern (x-axis), e.g., far left shows number of distinct patterns that occurred once, then the number of distinct patterns that each occur twice, etc; colors show the repositories (language) from which the source was obtained (to extract the regexs), and lines are fitted regression models of the form: <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_994_ef7bef2e41e2f585312843737db7c3c3.png" alt="NumPatterns = a*MultOccur^b" title="NumPatterns = a*MultOccur^b" />, where: <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_994.5_ed20a959d410ccd843d9e1dfcee04228.png" alt="a" title="a" /> is driven by the total amount of source processed and the frequency of occurrence of regexs in source, and <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_994.5_2afd410e2e5b23dad6f18513b2f72d0d.png" alt="b" title="b" /> is the rate at which duplicates occur.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.coding-guidelines.com/images/regex_pat-occur.png" alt="Number of distinct patterns occurring a given number of times in the source stored in various repositories" /></p>
<p>So most patterns occur once, and a few patterns occur lots of times (there is a long tail off to the unplotted right).</p>
<p>The following table shows values of <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_994.5_2afd410e2e5b23dad6f18513b2f72d0d.png" alt="b" title="b" /> for the various repositories (languages):</p>
<pre lang="C">
StackOverflow   cpan    godoc    maven    npm  packagist   pypi   rubygems
    -1.8        -2.5     -2.5    -2.4    -1.9     -2.6     -2.7     -2.4
</pre>
<p>The lower (i.e., closer to zero) the value of <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_994.5_2afd410e2e5b23dad6f18513b2f72d0d.png" alt="b" title="b" />, the more often the same regex will appear.</p>
<p>The values are in the region of -2.5, with two exceptions; why might StackOverflow and npm be different?  I can imagine lots of duplicates on StackOverflow, but npm (I&#8217;m not really familiar with this package ecosystem).</p>
<p>I am pleased to see such good regression fits, and close power law exponents (I would have been happy with an exponential fit, or any other equation;  I am interested in a consistent pattern across languages, not the pattern itself).</p>
<p>Some of the code is likely to be cloned, i.e., cut-and-pasted from a function in another package/program.  Copy rates as high as <a href="http://mondego.ics.uci.edu/projects/dejavu/">70% have been found</a>.  In this case, I don&#8217;t think cloned code matters.  If a particular regex is needed, what difference does it make whether the code was cloned or written from scratch?</p>
<p>If the same regex appears in source because of the same application requirement, the number of reuses should be correlated across languages (unless different languages are being used to solve different kinds of problems).  The plot below shows the correlation between number of occurrences of distinct regexs, for each pair of languages (or rather repos for particular languages; top left is StackOverflow).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.coding-guidelines.com/images/regex_lang-cor.png" alt="Correlation of number of identical pattern occurrences, between pairs of repositories." /></p>
<p>Why is there a mix of strong and weakly correlated pairs?  Is it because similar application problems tend to be solved using different languages?  Or perhaps there are different habits for cut-and-pasted source for developers using different repositories (which will cause some patterns to occur more often, but not others, and have an impact on correlation but not the regression fit).</p>
<p>There are lot of other interesting things that can be done with this data, when connected to the <a href="https://github.com/VTLeeLab/RegexGeneralizability-ASE19">results of the analysis of distinct regexs</a>, but these look like hard work, and <a href="http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/">I have a book</a> to finish.</p></div>

<p>Gung Ho! is a management book written by well-know author Ken Blanchard. It was somehow never on my radar, so because of the strange title and my unfamiliarity I wasn&#8217;t expecting too much, and I only picked it up because I know Blanchard&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_leadership_theory">other famous theory</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GungHo-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3116" width="512" height="512" />Gung Ho! Turn On the People in Any Organization &#8211; Ken Blanchard &amp; Sheldon Bowles (1997) &#8211; 143 pages</div>



<p>But it turned out to be a delightful, short read. This book can help any starting, aspiring or even seasoned manager to get their priorities straight about working with people. </p>



<p>The theory is built around three core ideas (<em>squirrel, beaver, goose</em>). Decide on <strong>meaningful work</strong>, decide on how you want to <strong>accomplish </strong>your task and <strong>encourage </strong>one another.</p>



<p>What makes the story enticing is that it is based in reality (or is it??). It is built around the story of a factory on the brink of a shutdown, and an old wise Indian who sets out to transform the factory with his new boss. It is sort of misty whether this actually happened (the protagonist herself has some pages in the acknowledgements but seems worried about her privacy). But as the book states in the end notes: it does not matter whether this actually happened: this is a universally applicable theory for every successful company. And I agree.</p>

<span class="date">February 07, 2020 01:16 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>The majority of source code has a short lifespan (i.e., a few years), and is only ever modified by one person (i.e., 60%).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Literate programming</a> is all well and good for code written to appear in a book that the author hopes will be read for many years, but this is a tiny sliver of the source code ecosystem.  The majority of code is never modified, once written, and does not hang around for very long; an investment is source code futures will make a loss unless the returns are spectacular.</p>
<p>What evidence do I have for these claims?</p>
<p>There is lots of evidence for the code having a short lifespan, and not so much for the number of people modifying it (and none for the number of people reading it).</p>
<p>The lifespan evidence is derived from data in my <a href="http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/">evidence-based software engineering</a> book, and blog posts on <a href="https://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2018/11/28/half-life-of-software-as-a-service-services/">software system lifespans</a>, and survival times of <a href="https://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2016/05/05/survival-time-of-linux-distributions/">Linux distributions</a>.  Lifespan in short because <a href="https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-code-data/blob/master/ecosystems/debsrc_packages-suites.R">Packages are updated</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-code-data/blob/master/ecosystems/li2016.R">third-parties change/delete APIs</a> (things may settle down in the future).</p>
<p>People who think source code has a long lifespan are suffering from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivorship bias</a>, i.e., there are a small percentage of programs that are actively used for many years.</p>
<p>Around <a href="https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-code-data/blob/master/evolution/functions/num-func-mods.R">60% of functions are only ever modified by one author</a>; based on <a href="http://oa.upm.es/10702/1/icsews12wetsom-id20-robles-6093-submitted.pdf">a study of the change history of functions</a> in Evolution (114,485 changes to functions over 10 years), and Apache (14,072 changes over 12 years); a study investigating the <a href="https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-code-data/blob/master/sourcecode/Taylor2012.R">number of people modifying files in Eclipse</a>.  Pointers to other studies that have welcome.</p>
<p>One consequence of the short life expectancy of source code is that, any investment made with the expectation of saving on future maintenance costs needs to return many multiples of the original investment.  When many programs don&#8217;t live long enough to be maintained, those with a long lifespan have to pay the original investments made in all the source that quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>One benefit of short life expectancy is that <a href="https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-code-data/blob/master/faults/tool-rep/warning-lifetime.R">most coding mistakes don&#8217;t live long enough to trigger a fault experience</a>; the code containing the mistake is deleted or replaced before anybody notices the mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Update: a few days later</strong></p>
<p>I was remiss in not posting some plots for people to look at (<a href="http://www.coding-guidelines.com/code-data/author-func-mod.tgz">code+data</a>).</p>
<p>The plot below shows number of function, in Evolution, modified a given number of times (left), and functions modified by a given number of authors (right).  The lines are a bi-exponential fit.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.coding-guidelines.com/images/author-mod-func.png" alt="Number of function, in Evolution, modified a given number of times (left), and functions modified by a given number of authors (right)." /></p>
<p>What is the interval (in hours) between between modifications of a function?  The plot below has a logarithmic x-axis, and is sort-of flat over most of the range (you need to squint a bit).  This is roughly saying that the probability of modification in hours 1-3 is the same as in hours 3-7, and hours, 7-15, etc (i.e., keep doubling the hour interval).  At round 10,000 hours function modification probability drops like a stone.</p>

<h4><a href="https://danluu.com/p95-skill/">95%-ile isn't that good</a>

<span class="date">February 07, 2020 12:00 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Reaching 95%-ile isn't very impressive because it's not that hard to do. I think this is one of my most ridiculable ideas. It doesn't help that, when stated nakedly, that sounds elitist. But I think it's just the opposite: most people can become (relatively) good at most things.</p>

<p>Note that when I say 95%-ile, I mean 95%-ile among people who participate, not all people (for many activities, just doing it at all makes you 99%-ile or above across all people). I'm also not referring to 95%-ile among people who practice regularly. The &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_weird_trick_advertisements">one weird trick</a>&quot; is that, for a lot of activities, being something like 10%-ile among people who practice can make you something like 90%-ile or 99%-ile among people who participate.</p>

<p>This post is going to refer to specifics since <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/926493613097439232">the discussions I've seen about this are all in the abstract</a>, which turns them into Rorschach tests. For example, Scott Adams has a widely cited post claiming that it's better to be a generalist than a specialist because, to become &quot;extraordinary&quot;, you have to either be &quot;the best&quot; at one thing or 75%-ile at two things. If that were strictly true, it would surely be better to be a generalist, but that's of course exaggeration and it's possible to get a lot of value out of a specialized skill without being &quot;the best&quot;; since the precise claim, as written, is obviously silly and the rest of the post is vague handwaving, discussions will inevitably devolve into people stating their prior beliefs and basically ignoring the content of the post.</p>

<p>Personally, in every activity I've participated in where it's possible to get a rough percentile ranking, people who are 95%-ile constantly make mistakes that seem like they should be easy to observe and correct. &quot;Real world&quot; activities typically can't be reduced to a percentile rating, but achieving what appears to be a similar level of proficiency seems similarly easy.</p>

<p>We'll start by looking at Overwatch (a video game) in detail because it's an activity I'm familiar with where it's easy to get ranking information and observe what's happening, and then we'll look at some &quot;real world&quot; examples where we can observe the same phenomena, although we won't be able to get ranking information for real world examples<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:S"><a rel="footnote" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fn:S">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="overwatch">Overwatch</h3>

<p>At 90%-ile and 95%-ile ranks in Overwatch, the vast majority of players will pretty much constantly make basic game losing mistakes. These are simple mistakes like standing next to the objective instead of on top of the objective while the match timer runs out, turning a probable victory into a certain defeat. See the attached footnote if you want enough detail about specific mistakes that you can decide for yourself if a mistake is &quot;basic&quot; or not<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:O"><a rel="footnote" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fn:O">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Some reasons we might expect this to happen are:</p>

<ol>
<li>People don't want to win or don't care about winning</li>
<li>People understand their mistakes but haven't put in enough time to fix them</li>
<li>People are untalented</li>
<li>People don't understand how to spot their mistakes and fix them</li>
</ol>

<p>In Overwatch, you may see a lot of (1), people who don’t seem to care about winning, at lower ranks, but by the time you get to 30%-ile, it's common to see people indicate their desire to win in various ways, such as yelling at players who are perceived as uncaring about victory or unskilled, complaining about people who they perceive to make mistakes that prevented their team from winning, etc.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:A"><a rel="footnote" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fn:A">3</a></sup>. Other than the occasional troll, it's not unreasonable to think that people are generally trying to win when they're severely angered by losing.</p>

<p>(2), not having put in time enough to fix their mistakes will, at some point, apply to all players who are improving, but if you look at the median time played at 50%-ile, people who are stably ranked there have put in hundreds of hours (and the median time played at higher ranks is higher). Given how simple the mistakes we're discussing are, not having put in enough time cannot be the case for most players.</p>

<p>A common complaint among low-ranked Overwatch players in Overwatch forums is that they're just not talented and can never get better. Most people probably don't have the talent to play in a professional league regardless of their practice regimen, but when you can get to 95%-ile by fixing mistakes like &quot;not realizing that you should stand on the objective&quot;, you don't really need a lot of talent to get to 95%-ile.</p>

<p>While (4), people not understanding how to spot and fix their mistakes, isn't the only other possible explanation<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:D"><a rel="footnote" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fn:D">4</a></sup>, I believe it's the most likely explanation for most players. Most players who express frustration that they're stuck at a rank up to maybe 95%-ile or 99%-ile don't seem to realize that they could drastically improve by observing their own gameplay or having someone else look at their gameplay.</p>

<p>One thing that's curious about this is that Overwatch makes it easy to spot basic mistakes (compared to most other activities). After you're killed, the game shows you how you died from the viewpoint of the player who killed you, allowing you to see what led to your death. Overwatch also records the entire game and lets you watch a replay of the game, allowing you to figure out what happened and why the game was won or lost. In many other games, you'd have to set up recording software to be able to view a replay.</p>

<p>If you read Overwatch forums, you'll see a regular stream of posts that are basically &quot;I'm SOOOOOO FRUSTRATED! I've played this game for 1200 hours and I'm still ranked 10%-ile, [some Overwatch specific stuff that will vary from player to player]&quot;. Another user will inevitably respond with something like &quot;we can't tell what's wrong from your text, please post a video of your gameplay&quot;. In the cases where the original poster responds with a recording of their play, people will post helpful feedback that will immediately make the player much better if they take it seriously. If you follow these people who ask for help, you'll often see them ask for feedback at a much higher rank (e.g., moving from 10%-ile to 40%-ile) shortly afterwards. It's nice to see that the advice works, but it's unfortunate that so many players don't realize that watching their own recordings or posting recordings for feedback could have saved 1198 hours of frustration.</p>

<p>It appears to be common for Overwatch players (well into 95%-ile and above) to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Want to improve</li>
<li>Not get feedback</li>
<li>Improve slowly when getting feedback would make improving quickly easy</li>
</ul>

<p>Overwatch provides the tools to make it relatively easy to get feedback, but people who very strongly express a desire to improve don't avail themselves of these tools.</p>

<h3 id="real-life">Real life</h3>

<p>My experience is that other games are similar and I think that &quot;real life&quot; activities aren't so different, although there are some complications.</p>

<p>One complication is that real life activities tend not to have a single, one-dimensional, objective to optimize for. Another is that what makes someone good at a real life activity tends to be poorly understood (by comparison to games and sports) even in relation to a specific, well defined, goal.</p>

<p>Games with rating systems are easy to optimize for: your meta-goal can be to get a high rating, which can typically be achieved by increasing your win rate by fixing the kinds of mistakes described above, like not realizing that you should step onto the objective. For any particular mistake, you can even make a reasonable guess at the impact on your win rate and therefore the impact on your rating.</p>

<p>In real life, if you want to be (for example) &quot;a good speaker&quot;, that might mean that you want to give informative talks that help people learn or that you want to give entertaining talks that people enjoy or that you want to give keynotes at prestigious conferences or that you want to be asked to give talks for $50k an appearance. Those are all different objectives, with different strategies for achieving them and for some particular mistake (e.g., spending 8 minutes on introducing yourself during a 20 minute talk), it's unclear what that means with respect to your goal.</p>

<p>Another thing that makes games, at least mainstream ones, easy to optimize for is that they tend to have a lot of aficionados who have obsessively tried to figure out what's effective. This means that if you want to improve, unless you're trying to be among the top in the world, you can simply figure out what resources have worked for other people, pick one up, read/watch it, and then practice. For example, if you want to be 99%-ile in a trick-taking card game like bridge or spades (among all players, not subgroups like &quot;ACBL players with masterpoints&quot; or &quot;people who regularly attend North American Bridge Championships&quot;), you can do this by:</p>

<ul>
<li>learning the basics of the game</li>
<li>reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2sUtmsk">a beginner book on cardplay</a></li>
<li>practicing applying the material</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to become a good speaker and you have a specific definition of “a good speaker” in mind, there still isn't an obvious path forward. Great speakers will give directly contradictory advice (e.g., avoid focusing on presentation skills vs. practice presentation skills). Relatively few people obsessively try to improve and figure out what works, which results in a lack of rigorous curricula for improving. However, this also means that it's easy to improve in percentile terms since relatively few people are trying to improve at all.</p>

<p>Despite all of the caveats above, my belief is that it's easier to become relatively good at real life activities relative to games or sports because there's so little delibrate practice put into most real life activities. Just for example, if you're a local table tennis hotshot who can beat every rando at a local bar, when you challenge someone to a game and they say &quot;sure, what's your rating?&quot; you know you're in shellacking by someone who can probably beat you while playing with a shoe brush. You're probably 99%-ile, but someone with no talent who's put in the time to practice the basics is going to have a serve that you can't return as well as be able to kill any shot a local bar expert is able to consitently hit. In most real life activities, there's almost no one who puts in a level of delibrate practice equivalent to someone who goes down to their local table tennis club and practices two hours a week, let alone someone like a top pro, who might seriously train for four hours a day.</p>

<p>To give a couple of concrete examples, I helped <a href="http://blog.leahhanson.us/speaking.html">Leah</a> prepare for talks from 2013 to 2017. The first couple practice talks she gave were about the same as you'd expect if you walked into a random talk at a large tech conference. For the first couple years she was speaking, she did something like 30 or so practice runs for each public talk, of which I watched and gave feedback on half. Her first public talk was (IMO) well above average for a talk at a large, well regarded, tech conference and her talks got better from there until she stopped speaking in 2017.</p>

<p>As we discussed above, this is more subjective than game ratings and there's no way to really determine a percentile, but if you look at how most people prepare for talks, it's not too surprising that Leah was above average. At one of the first conferences she spoke at, the night before the conference, we talked to another speaker who mentioned that they hadn't finished their talk yet and only had fifteen minutes of material (for a forty minute talk). They were trying to figure out how to fill the rest of the time. That kind of preparation isn't unusual and the vast majority of talks prepared like that aren't great.</p>

<p>Most people consider doing 30 practice runs for a talk to be absurd, a totally obsessive amount of practice, but I think Gary Bernhardt has it right when he says that, if you're giving a 30-minute talk to a 300 person audience, that's 150 person-hours watching your talk, so it's not obviously unreasonable to spend 15 hours practicing (and 30 practice runs will probably be less than 15 hours since you can cut a number of the runs short and/or repeatedly practice problem sections). One thing to note that this level of practice, considered obessive when giving a talk, still pales in comparison to the amount of time a middling table tennis club player will spend practicing.</p>

<p>If you've studied pedagogy, you might say that the help I gave to Leah was incredibly lame. It's known that having laypeople try to figure out how to improve among themselves is among the worst possible ways to learn something, good instruction is more effective and having a skilled coach or teacher give one-on-one instruction is more effective still<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:C"><a rel="footnote" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fn:C">5</a></sup>. That's 100% true, my help was incredibly lame. However, most people aren't going to practice a talk more than a couple times and many won't even practice a single time (I don't have great data proving this, this is from informally polling speakers at conferences I've attended). This makes Leah's 30 practice runs an extraordinary amount of practice compared to most speakers, which resulted in a relatively good outcome even though we were using one of the worst possible techniques for improvement.</p>

<p>My writing is another example. I'm not going to compare myself to anyone else, but my writing improved dramatically the first couple of years I wrote this blog just because I spent a little bit of effort on getting and taking feedback.</p>

<p>Leah read one or two drafts of almost every post and gave me feedback. On the first posts, since neither one of us knew anything about writing, we had a hard time identifying what was wrong. If I had some awkward prose or confusing narrative structure, we'd be able to point at it and say &quot;that looks wrong&quot; without being able to describe what was wrong or suggest a fix. It was like, in the era before spellcheck, when you misspelled a word and could tell that something was wrong, but every permutation you came up with was just as wrong.</p>

<p>My fix for that was to hire a professional editor whose writing I respected with the instructions &quot;I don't care about spelling and grammar fixes, there are fundamental problems with my writing that I don't understand, please explain to me what they are&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:F"><a rel="footnote" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fn:F">6</a></sup>. I think this was more effective than my helping Leah with talks because we got someone who's basically a professional coach involved. An example of something my editor helped us with was giving us a vocabulary we could use to discuss structural problems, the way <a href="https://amzn.to/2GPPmYE">design patterns</a> gave people a vocabulary to talk about OO design.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-this-blog-s-regularly-scheduled-topic-programming">Back to this blog's regularly scheduled topic: programming</h3>

<p>Programming is similar to the real life examples above in that it's impossible to assign a rating or calculate percentiles or anything like that, but it is still possible to make significant improvements relative to your former self without too much effort by getting feedback on what you're doing.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/926492239081197569">here's one thing Michael Malis did</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One incredibly useful exercise I’ve found is to watch myself program. Throughout the week, I have a program running in the background that records my screen. At the end of the week, I’ll watch a few segments from the previous week. Usually I will watch the times that felt like it took a lot longer to complete some task than it should have. While watching them, I’ll pay attention to specifically where the time went and figure out what I could have done better. When I first did this, I was really surprised at where all of my time was going.</p>

<p>For example, previously when writing code, I would write all my code for a new feature up front and then test all of the code collectively. When testing code this way, I would have to isolate which function the bug was in and then debug that individual function. After watching a recording of myself writing code, I realized I was spending about a quarter of the total time implementing the feature tracking down which functions the bugs were in! This was completely non-obvious to me and I wouldn’t have found it out without recording myself. Now that I’m aware that I spent so much time isolating which function a bugs are in, I now test each function as I write it to make sure they work. This allows me to write code a lot faster as it dramatically reduces the amount of time it takes to debug my code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the past, I've spent time figuring out where time is going when I code and basically saw the same thing as in Overwatch, except instead of constantly making game-losing mistakes, I was constantly doing pointlessly time-losing things. Just getting rid of some of those bad habits has probably been at least a 2x productivity increase for me, pretty easy to measure since fixing these is basically just clawing back wasted time. For example, I noticed how I'd get distracted for N minutes if I read something on the internet when I needed to wait for two minutes, so I made sure to keep a queue of useful work to fill dead time (and if I was working on something very latency sensitive where I didn't want to task switch, I'd do nothing until I was done waiting).</p>

<p>One thing to note here is that it's important to actually track what you're doing and not just guess at what you're doing. When I've recorded what people do and compare it to what they think they're doing, these are often quite different. It would generally be considered absurd to operate a complex software system without metrics or tracing, but it's normal to operate yourself without metrics or tracing, even though you're much more complex and harder to understand than the software you work on.</p>

<p><a href="http://danluu.com/hn-comments/#what-makes-engineers-productive-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-5496914">Jonathan Tang has noted that choosing the right problem dominates execution speed</a>. I don't disagree with that, but doubling execution speed is still decent win that's independent of selecting the right problem to work on and I don't think that discussing how to choose the right problem can be effectively described in the abstract and the context necessary to give examples would be much longer than the already too long Overwatch examples in this post, maybe I'll write another post that's just about that.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is sort of an odd post for me to write since I think that culturally, we care a bit too much about productivity in the U.S., especially in places I've lived recently (NYC &amp; SF). But at a personal level, higher productivity doing work or chores doesn't have to be converted into more work or chores, it can also be converted into more vacation time or more time doing whatever you value.</p>

<p>And for games like Overwatch, I don't think improving is a moral imperative; there's nothing wrong with having fun at 50%-ile or 10%-ile or any rank. But in every game I've played with a rating and/or league/tournament system, a lot of people get really upset and unhappy when they lose even when they haven't put much effort into improving. If that's the case, why not put a little bit of effort into improving and spend a little bit less time being upset?</p>

<h3 id="some-meta-techniques-for-improving">Some meta-techniques for improving</h3>

<ul>
<li>Get feedback and practice

<ul>
<li>Ideally from an expert coach but, if not, this can be from a layperson or even yourself (if you have some way of recording/tracing what you're doing)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Guided exercises or exercises with solutions

<ul>
<li>This is very easy to find in books for &quot;old&quot; games, like chess or Bridge.</li>
<li>For particular areas, you can often find series of books that have these, e.g., in math, books in the Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series (SUMS) tend to have problems with solutions</li>

<h3 id="appendix-other-most-ridiculable-ideas">Appendix: other most ridiculable ideas</h3>

<p>Here are the ideas I've posted about that were the most widely ridiculed at the time of the post:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/">It's not uncommon for programmers at trendy tech companies to make $350k/yr or more</a> (2015, stated number was $250k/yr at the time)</li>

<li><a href="http://danluu.com/cpu-bugs/">We should expect to see a lot more CPU bugs</a> (2016)</li>
<li><a href="http://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/">Markets are not incompatible with discrimination</a> (2014)</li>
<li><a href="http://danluu.com/input-lag/">Computers are getting slower in some ways</a> (2017)</li>
<li><a href="http://danluu.com/empirical-pl/">Empirical evidence on the benefit of types is almost non-existent</a> (2014)</li>
<li>It's reasonable to write technical posts on a subject that avoid domain-specific terminology</li>
</ul>

<p>My posts on compensation have the dubious distinction of being the posts most frequently called out both for being so obvious that they're pointless as well as  for being laughably wrong. I suspect they're also the posts that have had the largest aggregate impact on people -- I've had a double digit number of people tell me one of the compensation posts changed their life and they now make $x00,000/yr more than they used to because they know it's possible to get a much higher paying job and I doubt that I even hear from 10% of the people who make a big change as a result of learning that it's possible to make a lot more money.</p>

<p>When I wrote my first post on compensation, in 2015, I got ridiculed more for writing something obviously wrong than for writing something obvious, but the last few years things have flipped around. I still get the occasional bit of ridicule for being wrong when some corner of Twitter or a web forum that's well outside the HN/reddit bubble runs across my post, but the ratio of “obviously wrong” to “obvious” has probably gone from 20:1 to 1:5.</p>

<p>Opinions on monorepos have also seen a similar change since 2015. Outside of some folks at big companies, monorepos used to be considered obviously stupid among people who keep up with trends, but this has really changed. Not as much as opinions on compensation, but enough that I'm now a little surprised when I meet a hardline anti-monorepo-er.</p>

<p>Although it's taken longer for opinions to come around on CPU bugs, that's probably the post that now gets the least ridicule from the list above.</p>

<p>That markets don't eliminate all discrimination is the one where opinions have come around the least. Hardline &quot;all markets are efficient&quot; folks aren't really convinced by academic work like <a href="https://amzn.to/2Or7Z9k">Becker's The Economics of Discrimination</a> or summaries like <a href="http://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/">the evidence laid out in the post</a>.</p>

<p>The posts on computers having higher latency and the lack of empirical evidence of the benefit of types are the posts I've seen pointed to the most often to defend a ridicuable opinion. I didn't know when I started doing the work for either post and they both happen to have turned up evidence that's the opposite of the most common loud claims (there's very good evidence that advanced type systems improve safety in practice and of course computers are faster in every way, people who think they're slower are just indulging in nostalgia). I don't know if this has changed many opinion. However, I haven't gotten much direct ridicule for either post even though both posts directly state a position I see commonly ridiculed online. I suspect that's partially because both posts are empirical, so there's not much to dispute (though the post on discrimnation is also empirical, but it still gets its share of ridicule).</p>

<p>The last idea in the list is more meta: no one directly tells me that I should use more obscure terminology. Instead, I get comments that I must not know much about X because I'm not using terms of art. Using terms of art is a common way to establish credibility or authority, but that's something I don't really believe in. Arguing from authority doesn't tell you anything; adding needless terminology just makes things more difficult for readers who aren't in the field and are reading because they're interested in the topic but don't want to actually get into the field.</p>

<p>This is a pretty fundamental disagreement that I have with a lot of people. Just for example, I recently got into a discussion with an authority who insisted that it wasn't possible for me to reasonably disagree with them (I suggested we agree to disagree) because they're an authority on the topic and I'm not. It happens that I worked on the formal verification of a system very similar to the system we were discussing, but I didn't mention that because I don't believe that my status as an authority on the topic matters. If someone has such a weak argument that they have to fall back on an infallible authority, that's usually a sign that they don't have a well-reasoned defense of their position. This goes double when they point to themselves as the infallible authority.</p>

<p>I have about 20 other posts on stupid sounding ideas queued up in my head, but I mostly try to avoid writing things that are controversial, so I don't know that I'll write many of those up. If I were to write one post a month (much more frequently than my recent rate) and limit myself to 10% posts on ridiculable ideas, it would take 16 years to write up all of the ridiculable ideas I currently have.</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn:S"><p>The choice of Overwatch is arbitrary among activities I'm familiar with where:</p>

<ul>
<li>I know enough about the activity to comment on it</li>
<li>I've observed enough people trying to learn it that I can say if it's &quot;easy&quot; or not to fix some mistake or class of mistake</li>
<li>There's a large enough set of rated players is high enough to support the argument</li>
<li>Many readers will also be familiar with the activity</li>
</ul>

<p>99% of my gaming background comes from 90s video games, but I'm not going to use those as examples because relatively few readers will be familiar with those games. I could also use &quot;modern&quot; board games like Puerto Rico, Dominion, Terra Mystica, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Squad_Leader">ASL</a> etc., but the set of people who played in rated games is very low, which makes the argument less convincing (perhaps people who play in rated games are much worse than people who don't -- unlikely, but difficult to justify without comparing gameplay between rated and unrated games, which is pretty deep into weeds for this post).</p>

<p>There are numerous activities that would be better to use than Overwatch, but I'm not familiar enough with them to use them as examples. For example, on reading a draft of this post, Kevin Burke noted that he's observed the same thing while coaching youth basketball and multiple readers noted that they've observed the same thing in chess, but I'm not familiar enough with youth basketball or chess to confidently say much about either activity even they'd be better examples because it's likely that more readers are familiar with basketball or chess than with Overwatch.</p>
 <a class="footnote-return" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fnref:S"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>

<li id="fn:O"><p>When I first started playing Overwatch (which is when I did that experiment), I ended up getting rated slightly above 50%-ile (for Overwatch players, that was in Plat -- this post is going to use percentiles and not ranks to avoid making non-Overwatch players have to learn what the ranks mean). It's generally believed and probably true that people who play the main ranked game mode in Overwatch are, on average, better than people who only play unranked modes, so it's likely that my actual percentile was somewhat higher than 50%-ile and that all &quot;true&quot; percentiles listed in this post are higher than the nominal percentiles.</p>

<p>Some things you'll regularly see at slightly above 50%-ile are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Supports (healers) will heal someone who's at full health (which does nothing) while a teammate who's next to them is dying and then dies</li>
<li>Players will not notice someone who walks directly behind the team and kills people one at a time until the entire team is killed</li>
<li>Players will shoot an enemy until only one more shot is required to kill the enemy and then switch to a different target, letting the 1-health enemy heal back to full health before shooting at that enemy again</li>
<li>After dying, players will not wait for their team to respawn and will, instead, run directly into the enemy team to fight them 1v6. This will repeat for the entire game (the game is designed to be 6v6, but in ranks below 95%-ile, it's rare to see a 6v6 engagement after one person on one team dies)</li>
<li>Players will clearly have no idea what character abilities do, including for the character they're playing</li>
<li>Players go for very high risk but low reward plays (for Overwatch players, a classic example of this is Rein going for a meme pin when the game opens on 2CP defense, very common at 50%-ile, rare at 95%-ile since players who think this move is a good idea tend to have generally poor decision making).</li>
<li>People will have terrible aim and will miss four or five shots in a row when all they need to do is hit someone once to kill them</li>
<li>If a single flanking enemy threatens a healer who can't escape plus a non-healer with an escape ability, the non-healer will probably use their ability to run away, leaving the healer to die, even though they could easily kill the flanker and save their healer if they just attacked while being healed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having just one aspect of your gameplay be merely bad instead of atrocious is enough to get to 50%-ile. For me, that was my teamwork, for others, it's other parts of their gameplay. The reason I'd say that my teamwork was bad and not good or even mediocre was that I basically didn't know how to play the game, didn't know what any of the characters’ strengths, weaknesses, and abilities are, so I couldn't possibly coordinate effectively with my team. I also didn't know how the game modes actually worked (e.g., under what circumstances the game will end in a tie vs. going into another round), so I was basically wandering around randomly with a preference towards staying near the largest group of teammates I could find. That's above average.</p>

<p>You could say that someone is pretty good at the game since they're above average. But in a non-relative sense, being slightly above average is quite bad -- it's hard to argue that someone who doesn't notice their entire team being killed from behind while two teammates are yelling &quot;[enemy] behind us!&quot; over voice comms isn't bad.</p>

<p>After playing a bit more, I ended up with what looks like a &quot;true&quot; rank of about 90%-ile when I'm using a character I know how to use. Due to volatility in ranking as well as matchmaking, I played in games as high as 98%-ile. My aim and dodging were still atrocious. Relative to my rank, my aim was actually worse than when I was playing in 50%-ile games since my opponents were much better and I was only a little bit better. In 90%-ile, two copies of myself would probably lose fighting against most people 2v1 in the open. I would also usually lose a fight if the opponent was in the open and I was behind cover such that only 10% of my character was exposed, so my aim was arguably more than 10x worse than median at my rank.</p>

<p>My &quot;trick&quot; for getting to 90%-ile despite being a 1/10th aimer was learning how the game worked and playing in a way that maximized the probability of winning (to the best of my ability), as opposed to playing the game like it's an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathmatch">FFA</a> game where your goal is to get kills as quickly as possible. It takes a bit more context to describe what this means in 90%-ile, so I'll only provide a couple examples, but these are representative of mistakes the vast majority of 90%-ile players are making all of the time (with the exception of a few players who have grossly defective aim, like myself, who make up for their poor aim by playing better than average for the rank in other ways).</p>

<p>Within the game, the goal of the game is to win. There are different game modes, but for the mainline ranked game, they all will involve some kind of objective that you have to be on or near. It's very common to get into a situation where the round timer is ticking down to zero and your team is guaranteed to lose if no one on your team touches the objective but your team may win if someone can touch the objective and not die instantly (which will cause the game to go into overtime until shortly after both teams stop touching the objective). A concrete example of this that happens somewhat regularly is, the enemy team has four players on the objective while your team has two players near the objective, one tank and one support/healer. The other four players on your team died and are coming back from spawn. They're close enough that if you can touch the objective and not instantly die, they'll arrive and probably take the objective for the win, but they won't get there in time if you die immediately after taking the objective, in which case you'll lose.</p>

<p>If you're playing the support/healer at 90%-ile to 95%-ile, this game will almost always end as follows: the tank will move towards the objective, get shot, decide they don't want to take damage, and then back off from the objective. As a support, you have a small health pool and will die instantly if you touch the objective because the other team will shoot you. Since your team is guaranteed to lose if you don't move up to the objective, you're forced to do so to have any chance of winning. After you're killed, the tank will either move onto the objective and die or walk towards the objective but not get there before time runs out. Either way, you'll probably lose.</p>

<p>If the tank did their job and moved onto the objective before you died, you could heal the tank for long enough that the rest of your team will arrive and you'll probably win. The enemy team, if they were coordinated, could walk around or through the tank to kill you, but they won't do that -- anyone who knows that will cause them to win the game and can aim well enough to successfully follow through can't help but end up in a higher rank). And the hypothetical tank on your team  who knows that it's their job to absorb damage for their support in that situation and not vice versa won't stay at 95%-ile very long because they'll win too many games and move up to a higher rank.</p>

<p>Another basic situation that the vast majority of 90%-ile to 95%-ile players will get wrong is when you're on offense, waiting for your team to respawn so you can attack as a group. Even at 90%-ile, maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of players won't do this and will just run directly at the enemy team, but enough players will realize that 1v6 isn't a good idea that you'll often 5v6 or 6v6 fights instead of the constant 1v6 and 2v6 fights you see at 50%-ile. Anyway, while waiting for the team to respawn in order to get a 5v6, it's very likely one player who realizes that they shouldn't just run into the middle of the enemy team 1v6 will decide they should try to hit the enemy team with long-ranged attacks 1v6. People will do this instead of hiding in safety behind a wall even when the enemy has multiple snipers with instant-kill long range attacks. People will even do this against multiple snipers when they're playing a character that isn't a sniper and needs to hit the enemy 2-3 times to get a kill, making it overwhelmingly likely that they won't get a kill while taking a significant risk of dying themselves. For Overwatch players, people will also do this when they have full ult charge and the other team doesn't, turning a situation that should be to your advantage (your team has ults ready and the other team has used ults), into a neutral situation (both teams have ults) <em>at best</em>, and instantly losing the fight at worst.</p>

<p>If you ever read an Overwatch forum, whether that's one of the reddit forums or the official Blizzard forums, a common complaint is &quot;why are my teammates so bad? I'm at [90%-ile to 95%-ile rank], but all my teammates are doing obviously stupid game-losing things all the time, like [an example above]&quot;. The answer is, of course, that the person asking the questiiton is also doing obviously stupid game-losing things all the time because anyone who doesn't wins too much to stay at 95%-ile. This also applies to me.</p>

<p>People will argue that players at this rank <em>should</em> be good because they're better than 95% of other players, which makes them relatively good. But non-relatively, it's hard to argue that someone who doesn't realize that you should step on the objective to probably win the game instead of not touching the objective for a sure loss is good. One of the most basic things about Overwatch is that it's an objective-based game, but the majority of players at 90%-ile to 95%-ile don't play that way.</p>

<p>For anyone who isn't well into the 99%-ile, reviewing recorded games will reveal game-losing mistakes all the time. For myself, usually ranked 90%-ile or so, watching a recorded game will reveal tens of game losing mistakes in a close game (which is maybe 30% of losses, the other 70% are blowouts where there isn't a single simple mistake that decides the game).</p>

<p>It's generally not too hard to fix these since the mistakes are like the example above: simple enough that once you see that you're making the mistake, the fix is straightforward because the mistake is straightforward.</p>
 <a class="footnote-return" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fnref:O"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>

<li id="fn:A"><p>There are probably some people who just want to be angry at their teammates. Due to how infrequently you get matched with the same players, it's hard to see this in the main rated game mode, but I think you can sometimes see this when Overwatch sometimes runs mini-rated modes.</p>

<p>Mini-rated modes have a much smaller playerbase than the main rated mode, which has two notable side effects: players with a much wider variety of skill levels will be thrown into the same game and you'll see the same players over and over again if you play multiple games.</p>

<p>Since you ended up matched with the same players repeatedly, you'll see players make the same mistakes and cause themselves to lose in the same way and then have the same tantrum and blame their teammates in the same way game after game.</p>

<p>You'll also see tantrums and teammate blaming in the normal rated game mode, but when you see it, you generally can't tell if the person who's having a tantrum is just having a bad day or if it's some other one-off occurrence since, unless you're ranked very high or very low (where there's a smaller pool of closely rated players), you don't run into the same players all that frequently. But when you see a set of players in 15-20 games over the course of a few weeks and you see them lose the game for the same reason a double digit number of times followed by the exact same tantrum, you might start to suspect that some fraction of those people really want to be angry and that the main thing they're getting out of playing the game is a source of anger. You might also wonder about this from how some people use social media, but that's a topic for another post.</p>
 <a class="footnote-return" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fnref:A"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>

<li id="fn:D"><p>For example, there will also be players who have some kind of disability that prevents them from improving, but at the levels we're talking about, 99%-ile or below, that will be relatively rare (certainly well under 50%, and I think it's not unreasonable to guess that it's well under 10% of people who choose to play the game). IIRC, there's at least one player who's in the top 500 who's deaf (this is severely disadvantageous since sound cues give a lot of fine-grained positional information that cannot be obtained in any other way), at least one legally blind player who's 99%-ile, and multiple players with physical impairments that prevent them from having fine-grained control of a mouse, i.e., who are basically incapable of aiming, who are 99%-ile.</p>

<p>There are also other kinds of reasons people might not improve. For example, Kevin Burke has noted that when he coaches youth basketball, some children don't want to do drills that they think make them look foolish (e.g., avoiding learning to dribble with their off hand even during drills where everyone is dribbling poorly because they're using their off hand). When I spent a lot of time in a climbing gym with a world class coach who would regularly send a bunch of kids to nationals and some to worlds, I'd observe the same thing in his classes -- kids, even ones who are nationally or internationally competitive, would sometimes avoid doing things because they were afraid it would make them look foolish to their peers. The coach's solution in those cases was to deliberately make the kid look extremely foolish and tell them that it's better to look stupid now than at nationals. Similarly, but I view these as basically independent of the issue discussed in the post.</p>
 <a class="footnote-return" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fnref:D"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:C">note that, here, a skilled coach is someone who is skilled at coaching, not necessarily someone who is skilled at the activity. People who are skilled at the activity but who haven't explicitly been taught how to teach or spent a lot of time working on teaching are generally poor coaches.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="http://danluu.com/atom.xml#fnref:C"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:F">If you read the acknowledgements section of any of my posts, you can see that I get feedback from more than just two people on most posts (and I really appreciate the feedback), but I think that, by volume, well over 90% of the feedback I've gotten has come from Leah and a professional editor.

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/trash.png" alt="lock drawing" /></p>

<p><em>NB</em>: This is a repost on this blog of a post made on <a href="https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2249">nixers.net</a></p>

<p>No this isn’t a post trashing shell scripting.</p>

<p>Handling files on the command line is most of the time a
non-reversable process, a dangerous one in some cases (<a href="https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2055">Unix Horror
Stories</a>). There are tricks
to avoid the unnecessary loss and help in recovering files if need be.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Users do not expect that anything they delete is permanently
gone. Instead, they are used to a “Trash can” metaphor. A deleted
document ends up in a “Trash can”, and stays there at least for some
time — until the can is manually or automatically cleaned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this thread we’ll list what ideas we have on this topic, novel or
not so novel.</p>

<hr />

<p>There’s the usual aliasing of rm to mv into a specific directory,
a trash can for the command line.<br />
This can be combined with a cron job or timer that cleans files in this
directory that are older than a certain time.</p>

<p>You can check the actual XDG trash documentation that goes into great
details about what needs to be taken into consideration:<br />
<a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-1.0.html">https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-1.0.html</a></p>

<p>In <code class="highlighter-rouge">$HOME/.local/share/Trash</code> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">$XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash</code>) and usually at least
split into two directories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>files</strong> for the actual exact copy of the files and directories
  (including their permission, and they should not override if two have
  the same names)</li>
  <li><strong>info</strong>, that contains the information about where and what name the
deleted file had, in case it needs to be restored. And also the date it
was deleted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another way to avoid losing files is to keep backups of the file
system. This can be done via a logical volume management be it included
in the file system itself (ZFS, btrfs, etc..) or not.</p>

<p>So, what’s your command line trash, how do you deal with avoidable losses.</p></div>

<h4>💣 Remote exploit in OpenSMTPd  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/WaitingForTheJobsToFinish#exploit_opensmtpd" name="exploit_opensmtpd" class="permalink">&#128279;</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://poolp.org/posts/2020-01-30/opensmtpd-advisory-dissected/">OpenSMTPD advisory dissected</a>
(5 min,
<a href="https://bsd.network/@brynet/103579748648371641">via</a>)</p>

<p>The author of OpenSMTPd does a good post-mortem of the catastrophic bug that has left a remote exploit
available for three years and a half.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can’t prevent human mistakes, they will happen because tools won’t help spot that a human-described 
logic is flawed. What we need is to make changes so that OpenSMTPD becomes more resistant to human 
errors. In other words, we need safe-guards that are not dependant on sanity checks and input, we need 
safe-guards that will guarantee that even if OpenSMTPD lets completely untrusted input pass through, 
this will have the most limited consequences... then we ensure that it doesn’t let untrusted input pass through.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. There is no such thing as bug-free code. </p>

<p>Besides the actual forensics of the hack, which are not very in depth, this report provides
an interesting insight into the tools and environments that real security firms use to 
study malware. It seems that Cellebrite's software is very popular.</p>

<p>Be sure to read <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22151023">the HN discussion</a>, which seems to agree with my
point: the forensic analysis was not very good, but the between-lines content is insightful.</p>

<p>Apparently the second in a series, which explains the rather abrupt <em>mis-en-scene</em>. I guess is this a <acronym title="young adult">YA</acronym> novel, but I wonder how many in the target audience are up to snuff with interwar British public school slang.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s well creepy, though. Newman has come quite a way since I read <em>Anno Dracula</em> back in the day, and I haven&#8217;t really read much of his stuff after that. The setting is between the wars, and some people are Unusuals - they can do magic, basically. In a all-girls boarding school, <em>something</em> returns after a disastrous trip to London&#8230; </p></div>
